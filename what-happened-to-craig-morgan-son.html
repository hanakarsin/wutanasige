What some people might not know is the story behind that loss — which happened back in 2016, when his son, Jerry, was only 19 years old.</p><p>So what happened to Craig's son anyway? Let's take a closer look at the circumstances surrounding the accident that unexpectedly claimed his son's life.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Facebook</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to Craig Morgan's son?</h2><p>On July 10, 2016, 19-year-old <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jerry Greer went missing after a tubing accident</a>. Jerry was being pulled behind a boat on Kentucky Lake in Tennessee — not that far away from his family's home in Dickson — when he went under. Although he was wearing a life jacket at the time, he didn't resurface.</p><p>A large and highly-coordinated search ensued, leading to Jerry's body being found the next day.</p><p>"We just had to find him," Karen Greer, Jerry's mother and Craig's wife, told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> in 2018. "We just had to find his body. We had to deal with Alex, Kyle and Wyatt. That was it. Jerry was gone, and we knew that. I wanted him found. I didn’t want to get a call six months later.”</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><span>Source: YouTube</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Craig's song "The Father, My Son and the Holy Ghost" is about Jerry.</h2><p>In 2019, Craig released his first new music since the death of his son, who had been fostered as a baby and then adopted as a young child by Craig and his wife. He did so with a single titled "The Father, My Son and the Holy Ghost."</p><p>“Its simplicity embraces the truth of the lyrics of the song,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Craig told CMT,</a> of the accompanying music video. “I hope this video lifts people up. For anyone who has experienced loss, I want this song to give them the desire to pursue their faith and to have hope.”</p><p>The song ended up reaching the number one spot on iTunes' all-genre chart thanks in part to fellow country singer <a href=#>Blake Shelton</a>, who encouraged others to support it.</p><p>"I would gladly give up my spot on country radio to get this song on. Wow @cmorganmusic you blow me away brother," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Blake tweeted in September 2019</a>. "There’s nothing easy or fun about writing a song like this but sometimes it’s just something you gotta do."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I would gladly give up my spot on country radio to get this song on..

Seems like just yesterday we were wrestling at turkey camp and laying on the roof looking at stars loving and laughing at everything in life," he captioned the post. "With Jerry there were more good days than bad, more laughter than anger, more sunshine than rain, His time on earth affected everyone he met in a positive way."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p>23 years ago today he was born and God gave him to us.
