Or not roll in, as it were. And just like you, we‚Äôve got lots of questions. Can Trump run again if he loses in 2020? Why is it taking so long for some states to report results? Does Joe Biden have a dog? (Hey, we never said all of the questions were hard-hitting!)</p><p>We also noticed that a lot of people have questions about the results that have already come in, specifically in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wisconsin</a>. Some people are claiming that the Badger State ‚Äî which has already been called for Joe Biden ‚Äî is showing <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">more votes than there are registered voters</a>. What‚Äôs going on there?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Why does Wisconsin have more votes than registered voters?</h2><p>Every person who is registered to vote can only vote one time ‚Äî that‚Äôs always been the case, although in 2020, it‚Äôs worth reiterating just to make sure that we‚Äôre all on the same page. Obviously, that means that the number of counted votes cannot exceed the number of registered voters in each state.&nbsp;</p><p>However, after Wisconsin turned blue, some took to social media to point out that the number of counted votes and the number of registered voters didn‚Äôt match up. Specifically, one viral tweet (which has since been deleted) claimed that Wisconsin had only 3,129,000 registered voters, but was reporting a count of 3,239,920. Clear evidence of fraud, right?</p><p>Well, no. As a matter of fact, the people sowing unrest regarding the Wisconsin votes were actually just misinformed and working from an incorrect set of data (we‚Äôll give them the benefit of the doubt on this one and assume it was an honest mistake). That 3,129,000 is the number of registered voters in Wisconsin in 2018 ‚Äî not in 2020.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>If you‚Äôre seeing information like the first picture. Do a quick search. Wisconsin has almost 3.7 million registered voters <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/TdtC5nkI0w</a></p>‚Äî ZP üçû (@zpauly) <a href=#>November 4, 2020</a></figure><p>According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wisconsin Elections Commission</a>, the state had 3,684,726 active registered voters on Nov. 1, 2020. As of the time of this writing, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Times</a> is reporting a total of 3,297,420 ballots cast in total (which also calls into question the other number in the tweet that incorrectly claimed fraud had occurred). Also, Wisconsin is one of the states that allow <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">same-day voter registration</a>, so the number of registered voters on Election Day was likely even higher.</p><p>In other words, the numbers coming out of Wisconsin are well within the expected ranges, and there is no evidence of fraudulent ballots being added to inflate Joe Biden‚Äôs final tally.&nbsp;</p><p>As with all claims on the internet ‚Äî and perhaps especially with claims related to historic elections ‚Äî&nbsp;it‚Äôs important to do a little bit of extra digging in order to verify the info before blindly retweeting or sharing a Facebook update. In this particular instance, the claim was very easy to debunk with a couple of quick Google searches, but that didn‚Äôt stop thousands of people from sharing the incorrect information online. Do your due diligence before blindly retweeting, folks!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOonKxlp57ApLvNrKCnZZiWw6Z5zKipnmWmpMGmv4ytn5qmXaeyqLXSrZyrnZRiw7DAxKuq</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
