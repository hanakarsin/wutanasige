This led to Jonathan’s defeat in the election.</p><p>Wike’s camp, which is demanding the resignation of the National Chairman of the PDP, Iyorchia Ayu, and his replacement by a southern candidate, have accused Atiku of refusing to support Jonathan in 2015, claiming it was the turn of the north to produce Nigeria’s president.</p><p>Governor Wike, Governor Seyi Makinde of Oyo State, and others had <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>pulled out of the Atiku Presidential Campaign Council until Ayu is removed or resigned.</a></strong></p><p>Speaking to Daily Sun, an insider in Rivers PDP said those within Wike’s camp argued that in 2014/2015, Atiku was one of those who spearheaded the breakup of the party under former president, Jonathan, after they insisted it was the turn of the north to produce the president.</p><p>According to the insider said Wike’s camp believed that just like Atiku opposed Jonathan and insisted on the north producing the president, Ayu would have to resign for a southerner to replace him for justice and fair play.</p><p>The source said: “For a long time, Ayu’s camp has been very arrogant about the call for his resignation, but this may cost them everything. When Atiku left PDP in 2014, it was people like Wike, Peter Obi, and Ayo Fayose that remained in the party to ensure it survives. If they had left like Atiku and his supporters did, would there have been any party to return to? At this rate, we do not mind if this house falls. If it falls, it will be rebuilt after the 2023 election.</p><p>“By Friday, everything would be out in the open and the plans would be fully activated. We are ready for anything. The same way Wike’s camp kept the party and made it attractive will be the same way it would be buried and rebuilt after the 2023 elections. We would not allow Atiku to benefit from his arrogance.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e5FsZpqsmaDCbrXNrKCsrJWZeqrAjLCYrGWepL%2B1tNJmq66qnmK2r3mRaWhuZZyasW68w6lkm6qVlrhuwc9mrKeclad6q7vNmquhmZ5k</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
