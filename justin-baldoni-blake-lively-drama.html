Although fans are super invested in the characters, there is allegedly some turmoil happening off-screen. What's up with the Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively drama?

And yet they all follow one another ‚Äî but not Justin," the sleuth said.</p><p>But wait, there's more!</p><p>The Redditor also claims that Justin is not included in "any of the endless promo on Blake‚Äôs social media," although "she loves to mention numerous people in those captions so skipping over the director/lead actor seems like a choice!"</p><p>A quick perusal of Justin's social media shows that he was recently sick with an infection and spent a week in the hospital. So that could explain why he hadn't been promoting the film as heavily for a hot minute.</p><p>Is he still promoting the film now?</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Justin Baldoni (@justinbaldoni)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">It isn't true that Justin Baldoni is not doing press for 'It Ends With Us.'</h2><p>At the time of writing, Justin is heavily promoting the movie on his social media.
