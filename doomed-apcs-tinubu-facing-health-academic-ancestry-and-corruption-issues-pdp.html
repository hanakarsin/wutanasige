They don’t understand the transmission lines and the need for maintenance. They couldn’t make a down payment for the trail track. They are a political party of termites,” he had said.</p><p>Reacting in a statement on Wednesday by its National Publicity Secretary, Hon Debo Ologunagba, the PDP said the APC’s presidential candidate is battling many personal, health, academic, ancestry and corruption issues.</p><p>While describing the APC as a termite party, the PDP said Tinubu is dazed by the achievement and popularity of its candidate, Atiku Abubakar.</p><p>Ologunagba said&nbsp;the doomed APC that is crawling, having become legally crippled and no longer a legitimate and valid vehicle to field candidates in the 2023 general elections.</p><p>The statement read in part: “For emphasis, the PDP is a serious political Party campaigning on issues and we have refrained from commenting on the many personal, health, academic, ancestry and corruption issues challenging the APC Presidential Candidate.</p><p>“Apparently, dazed by the resounding presentation of the PDP Presidential Candidate, Atiku Abubakar at the hugely successful flag-off of our Presidential Campaign in Uyo, Akwa-Ibom State, on Monday, October 10, 2022, Asiwaju Tinubu has become disoriented to the extent that he can no longer articulate or engage in any productive and focused political discourse.</p><p>“This explains why the APC cannot constitute a Presidential Campaign Council, let alone flag off its campaign.</p><p>“Though the APC Presidential Candidate has demeaned himself before Nigerians, the PDP as a decorous Party will still refrain from commenting on the issues of his personal health and alleged unwholesome addictions for which he has become a butt of public joke.</p><p>“Since he procured the APC ticket, the APC Presidential Candidate has not made any meaningful comment or contribution to serious national issues, instead he has been engaging in illogical, incoherent and fatuous utterances.”</p><p>The PDP cautioned Tinubu&nbsp;to advise himself, guard his utterances, face his many legitimacy and disqualification issues and stop making himself an object of public ridicule.</p><p>The party asked the former Lagos State governor to apologize to Nigerians for the woes and suffering brought upon the country by the misrule of the APC which he helped to install and for which Nigerians hold him personally responsible.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5BsZp2nn6KypXnAqZqsZaSeu7au1GadmpuZo7RutMSao62gXZaworDEpqCcZZGjsKa%2F06uwZpmemXqku9GrrKmsmaS7brXSrKyeq12lsbF7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
