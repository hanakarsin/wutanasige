Paul Rudd reprises his role as Ant-Man in Episode 1 and sheds light on a longtime debate among fans of the MCU. For context, you’ll need to rewatch the 2015 film.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">‘The Avengers: Endgame’ (2019)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Marvel Studios</span><p>Thanos in 'Avengers: Endgame'</p></figure><p>We can’t force you to spend three hours of your life recapping the havoc that was wreaked upon the MCU by Thanos in Avengers: Endgame, but here's why you should.</p><p>Ms. Marvel takes place roughly two years after the finger snap heard ‘round the world.
