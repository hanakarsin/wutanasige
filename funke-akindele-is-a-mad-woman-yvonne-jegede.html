It was something different from what I had been doing, and I loved it.</p><p>“When you see her on TV, you would think, oh, she loves to have fun, play around, dance and be goofy. Haaaa! that’s a lie o she’s a mad woman (screamed). She’s a very serious person when she’s onset. And I think that made my respect for her go really high. Now, I can’t even call her Funke to her face I have to call her big sis because my respect for her has doubled. She’s an insane filmmaker.</p><p>“Every department she holds down is done to perfection. And I think this is because she overprepares before she comes on set, so she knows every single thing; every department is inside her brain. To be honest, she’s good.”&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ze5BuZp%2BtnqCybq3KoqWdnZyaeqq%2FjJpkppmUYsSwucCnZLKun6O7pnnJnp6enJVk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
