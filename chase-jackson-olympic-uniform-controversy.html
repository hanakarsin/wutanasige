Before you draw conclusions or dive into online debates about the Chase uniform controversy, here’s everything you need to know!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Chase Jackson's uniform controversy explained.</h2><p>Every Olympics season, multiple clothing brands sign up to <a href=#>lend their designs to the athletes</a>. The 2024 games were no different, as Ralph Lauren, SKIMS, and Nike all gifted the athletes with uniform kits. While some, like Lululemon, didn’t quite meet fan expectations, others were praised for infusing rich cultural elements into their designs.</p><p>But Chase, unlike her peers, said she could not wear most of the designer digs.</p><p>"When you spend your first hour in Paris crying cause they didn't give you anything in your size," Chase wrote in her Instagram story that was reposted on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">X</a>. The post quickly drew concern from both fans and the public.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@chaseypoosp</a></figure><p>In fact, many social media commenters began bashing the brands, especially Kim Kardashian's brand, SKIMS, which has <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">discussed the importance of inclusivity</a> in its promotions. However, it appears the issue with the uniforms was a mishap unrelated to inclusivity.</p><p>Amid the controversy, Chase wrote several more posts that clarified the situation. She thanked her supporters for their "kind words" and confirmed she didn't receive the wrong uniforms because of her size. Chase said the mishap was an "admin error" that was resolved by each brand.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@chaseypoosp</a></figure><p>"Just to be clear, all brands do have my size; it just wasn't given to me originally, but I have it now," she confirmed. "There was no exclusion or anything. It was just a super unfortunate logistical nightmare!"</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@chaseypoosp</a></figure><p>Chase wrote in another Instagram story that she spoke out about her perceived mistreatment due to similar situations happening to her in the past. However, she said she was "thankful that's not the case" and shared that she was ready to move on and continue with sweeping another Olympic season. Chase also offered to "talk to anyone" about the situation further but added, "It'll be after I'm done competing."</p><p>Boom!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Nike also sparked controversy before the 2024 Olympics with its high-cut leotard design.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>BREAKING: Here's your first look at the new <a href=#>@Nike</a> kits that will be worn by the U.S. track and field team at the 2024 Olympics in Paris. <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/XPWOnBrwsv</a></p>— CITIUS MAG (@CitiusMag) <a href=#>April 11, 2024</a></figure><p>Speaking of nightmares, Nike began facing backlash even before the 2024 Olympic Games kicked off. Some weren’t fond of its high-cut leotard design. After a side-by-side photo of the men’s and women’s uniforms was released, accusations of sexism emerged, with critics suggesting the brand prioritized style over functionality, calling it “skimpy," per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Guardian</a>.</p><p>Tara Davis-Woodhall weighed in, remarking, “Wait my hoo haa is gonna be out." However, some argued that the photo didn’t accurately reflect how the outfit fit in reality.
