But when these couples are confronted with their exes, is the idea of marriage still on the table?</p><p>In an exclusive clip obtained by Distractify ahead of the March 30 episode of Ex of the Beach: Couples, <a href=#>show host Kamie Crawford</a> confronts the partners with video footage of what their significant other said and did while they were not with them at the villa.
