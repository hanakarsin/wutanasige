Our Emirs were all in exile.”</p><p>“Today, Bama is coming back to life and so is Askira-Uba, Damboa, Gwoza and others. Life is even returning to Baga. This was impossible before Buhari.”</p><p>“In fact, it was not possible to move few kilometres out of Maiduguri. Insurgents were so bold to attack and take over military facilities, like the Army Barracks at Monguno, Bama, Giwa Barrack and Multinational Joint Task Force Headquarters at Baga, to mention just a few. There were daily bomb blast attacks in many parts of Maiduguri, the most populated part of the state but all these have stopped under President Buhari. These are the records and no one can dispute them,” the statement reads in part.</p><p>Adesina also went ahead to list some checklist of military performances and successes recorded under the Buhari administration.</p><p>“200 kidnapped victims rescued by troops of Operation Lafiya Dole. A total of 1,385 rounds of ammunition, 45 grenades as well as 95 assorted rifles were recovered from BHT/ISWAP fighters. In addition, several gun trucks were captured, while some others were destroyed during air strikes. 1,805 insurgents/terrorists including commanders were killed by the troops aside scores killed by air raids/attacks. Additionally, within the period, a total of 79 arrests were made including high value targets.</p><p>“Troops of Operations Safe Haven, Whirl Stroke and Thunder Strike rescued a total of 130 kidnapped victims, and 105 assorted rifles as well as 513 rounds of ammunition and 1,055 rustled cattle were recovered from armed bandits and other criminal elements in the zone. 1,250 criminals, including family members of the Darul Salam sect, were arrested within the period. Furthermore, troops neutralised a total of 125 armed bandits including militia gang leaders.”</p><p>“The Nigerian Air Force (NAF) on 2 January, 2021, conducted a Joint Combat Search and Rescue (CSAR), Special Forces (SF) and Air Police K-9 Simulation Exercise (JCSAEX) at Rijana Village along Kaduna-Abuja Highway.”</p><p>“The Exercise, code named ‘Taimako Yazo’, was aimed at simulating tactics, doctrine and synergy amongst first responders for effective CSAR operations of downed aircrew or other NAF personnel who have had to eject or abandon their aircraft in emergency situations.</p><p>“The ability to rescue crew from hostile environments is particularly important as it can be adapted for anti-kidnapping operations, as was recently done by the NAF in concert with other security agencies in the rescue of all the 344 kidnapped boys of Government Science Secondary School, Kankara, Katsina State.</p><p>“The Air Force will conduct a total of six of these exercises between January and June 2021, mostly in the north-west, particularly in Zamfara and Katsina states,” Adesina noted in part.</p><p>Meanwhile, President Muhammadu Buhari has asked critics of his administration to <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>judge his performance</a></strong> with fairness and equity.</p><p>Speaking when he received the Executive Secretary of the Nigeria Christian Pilgrims Commission, <strong>Reverend Yakubu Pam</strong>, at the State House in Abuja on Thursday, Buhari asked his critics to consider all factors before rating his performance.</p><p>He also asked his critics to consider where the country was in 2015 and where it is currently, the resources available to work with and how much had been achieved with the available resources.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH1ye5BuZqKmo5qwtr7IrbBmmqWdrrO1jKGYrGWgmr%2Bnu9GmnJ1lkprBtbHRZquhmZ5it7C6wK2fmqZdpb%2Bmv8idnKebqWKvsK3Srapo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
