Three accredited for the screening. One was cleared, two were not cleared. So, we are only attending to those that have been cleared, the aspirant that has been cleared by the two committees,” he declared.</p><p>Reacting to the entire episode, Kperogi said Tinubu should expect a payback from Karma in Abuja during the APC presidential primaries.</p><p>He said Tinubu would not get a fair presidential primaries just as he allegedly prevented a fair governorship primaries in Lagos.</p><p>“Tinubu endorsed a disgraceful coronation of his handpicked stooge in the Lagos governorship primary “election” and shut out 2 other contestants who paid nomination fees. But he wants a fair contest for his presidential ambition in Abuja and chafes at consensus. Karma is waiting for him in Abuja this weekend!,” Kperogi said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH12e5FwZmtoYmh6rLzEq6agoV2XuaK%2F06xkraGeqq%2B2edaaqaerXZ22rnnOp2SwoJGperW7jJ6vqZ2TqXqiwIytn55lkaWwbrzRnqqinJWjwaqty2anq6Gdlr%2BqsdJo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
