The mode allowed a player to bring two buddies into a match by queueing up together, making for some hectic fun and team coordination to squeeze out a win.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Epic Games</span></figure><p>With Trios now gone, players can only queue up for Solos, Duos, and Squads in Fortnite.</p><p>Its sudden removal has got many wondering why Epic Games scrapped the mode in the first place. We may be able to explain what drove the devs to axe Trios.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why did 'Fortnite' remove Trios?</h2><p>On May 13, Epic Games <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">published a blog</a> detailing Ranked Play, which was updated on May 16 hours before the competitive mode released to tell players that Trios would get shelved for the foreseeable future:</p><p>"Please note that the Trios mode will be vaulted in Battle Royale and Zero Build in v24.40," the updated note reads.</p><p>Epic Games has yet to explain why Trios got removed in Fortnite days later, fueling player backlash across the internet. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">One player on Reddit</a> explained Trios "was the only good way to play with [their] friends."</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Another user</a> responding to the news argued, "this [was] a horrible change. I mostly play with two other players and we were so happy when Trios was first added. What the h--l are they doing?"</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Fortnite: We're removing Trios to help make queue times faster!<br>The queue time: <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/OYdR6dWNfG</a></p>— Hushxed (@Hushxed) <a href=#>May 17, 2023</a></figure><p>Some players on that thread <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">speculate</a> Epic Games got rid of Trios to give Ranked Play a smoother launch.</p><p>The theory aligns with the thoughts of Twitch streamer SypherPK, who <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">stated</a>, "I know some people are upset about this, but with Ranked mode coming [the] player count could get really split, and queue times could get out of hand."</p><p>So far, we only have assumptions, but players are calling for Epic to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">communicate the reasoning</a> behind the removal.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Will Trios ever come back in 'Fortnite'?</h2><p>It's hard to say whether Trios will come back again in Fortnite. The decision from Epic Games won't have an immediate reversal, and we don't have a clear idea of what the team has planned for the game's future chapters.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I know some people are upset about this but with ranked mode coming player count could get really split and queue times could get out of hand. <a href=#>https://t.co/RhHTln0gMi</a></p>— SypherPK (@SypherPK) <a href=#>May 16, 2023</a> <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Epic Games via Twitter</a></figure><p>It could return as a limited-time mode like in its heyday, but as noted above, many fans used Trios as a permanent way to connect with friends and play matches. It would be a disservice to this audience of players to slap it on and lose it again, but time will tell if we'll ever see it in the future.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2aen6fBr7XTnmSrnZ2kw6Z506ugqKs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
