He noted that two terrorists carried AK-47 riffles while the third one was their rider.</p><p>“Our gallant troops killed insurgents members in Gubio general areas and two AK47 rIffles with two magazines as well as a motorcycle were recovered from the terrorists,” the source said.</p><p>In another news, gunmen murdered a vigilante, <strong>Muhammed Oke</strong>, in Isaga/Ilewo-Orile in Abeokuta-North Local Government Area of Ogun State.</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> learnt that the deceased, who was the head of vigilante and ward 15 chairmen of the African Democratic Congress (ADC), in Isaga/Ilewo-Orile was killed after receiving a distress call on Thursday around 8:30 a.m.</p><p>The state Police Public Relations Officer, <strong>Abimbola Oyeyemi,</strong> who confirmed the dire incident on Saturday, said investigations were ongoing.</p><p>Oyeyemi said, “It’s true he was killed. What I heard is that some people said they saw some gunmen hiding at a place and they now called the man, since he is a vigilante in the community; so they went there to attack those gunmen.</p><p>“On getting there, the gunmen had laid ambush for them and that’s how he got shot. One person died while one was injured.</p><p>“But we have commenced an investigation into it.”</p><p>The PPRO, however, debunked claims that the murder was an assassination, adding that the command would not restrict the scope of the investigation.</p><p>He said the police investigation would unveil the circumstance that led to the death of the vigilante leader.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ye49vZq2gopqybq7OpKZmoJGnrq55056pq6einsC1v4ykoKWklZl6or%2BMramop6CoeqS7zJtkm6eio7xur86mpK6mmam2pr%2BO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
