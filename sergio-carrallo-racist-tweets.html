Amid the chaos, <a href=#>Caroline Stanbury’s</a> husband got caught in the crossfire.</p><p>In 2021, Caroline tied the knot with Spanish pro soccer player <a href=#>Sergio José Carrallo Pendás</a> after two years of dating. Earlier this season, the pair started their <a href=#>IVF journey</a> with hopes of welcoming a baby in the near future.</p><p>However, the pro-athlete-turned-reality TV star recently found himself in hot water when his past came back to haunt him. Sergio was under fire after a racist tweet posted in 2016 went viral. And at part one of the reunion, <a href=#>Andy Cohen</a> wasn’t afraid to stir the pot.</p><p>So, what did Sergio say that put him at the center of controversy? Read on to find out!</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram/@sergiocarrallo</span><p>Sergio Carrallo and Caroline Stanbury</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">‘Real Housewives of Dubai’ star Sergio José Carrallo Pendás’ racist tweets resurfaced on social media.</h2><p>The internet never forgets and this was especially true for Sergio during Season 1 of RHODubai. Some internet sleuthing revealed that he used a racial slur in a 2016 post on Twitter. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">since-deleted tweet</a> — which linked back to a promotional photo for a nightclub in Spain — read, “Every n***a in my crew. This is it.”</p><p>Not long after the series premiere of RHODubai, the resurfaced tweet went viral.</p><p>Since then, several viewers have taken to social media to share their concerns about his use of the n-word. But according to Caroline, Sergio is the “least racist person” you’ll ever meet.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@sergiocarrallo</a><p>Sergio Carrallo and Caroline Stanbury</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Caroline Stanbury responded to the allegations against her husband at the ‘Real Housewives of Dubai’ reunion.</h2><p>Viewers on social media praised <a href=#>Chanel Ayan</a> and <a href=#>Lesa Milan Hall</a> for having the courage to call Sergio out at the reunion. Sadly, the same can’t be said for the Carolines, who faced major backlash for defending Sergio in the episode.</p><p>Sergio’s wife insisted that he is woefully apologetic, while <a href=#>Caroline Brooks</a> also chimed in with her two cents. Brooks alleged that she spoke to both Caroline and Sergio the day the tweet resurfaced on social media.</p><p>The RHODubai star explained, “That morning when I saw it… when it surfaced, Caroline called me first — furious, pissed — then I got on the phone with him because he was really upset."</p><p>“Sergio then explained to me he's never even heard that word before. I explained to him how problematic that is, as did Caroline, and I think he got a good enough lashing from everybody around him for that. He was very apologetic. He didn't apologize publicly but he was apologetic," Brooks went on.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Bravo</span><p>Caroline Brooks and Caroline Stanbury</p></figure><p>Sergio’s RHODubai co-star, <a href=#>Sara Al Madani</a>, also had a shocking revelation about the situation to share at the reunion. The reality star claimed that she had hired a team of tech experts to thoroughly investigate the tweets in question.</p><p>According to Sara, the results suggested that Sergio wasn’t responsible. “They investigated everything,” she revealed. “And it wasn't attached to his Instagram. Somebody used his Twitter to promote an R&B nightclub because he was famous back then. He said someone else wrote it to promote it."</p><p>New episodes of The Real Housewives of Dubai air on Wednesdays at 9 p.m. ET on Bravo. You can also stream the series on Peacock.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqLKzs8ioZJyZoqeurbjOZqmam5mowW7A1p6cras%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
