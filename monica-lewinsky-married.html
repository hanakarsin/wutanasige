The '90s scandal, which ultimately led to Clinton's impeachment, is being told from Monica's perspective.</p><p>In the aftermath of the affair, Monica was thrust into the spotlight and, by many, cast as the villain in the very public narrative.</p><p>“I ceased being a three-dimensional person. Instead, I became a whore, a bimbo, a slut, and worse," she wrote in an op-ed for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The New York Times</a>. Following the scandal, Monica has taken on a few titles, such as author, anti-bullying activist, television personality, and more. So, what about her personal life? Is the 48-year-old ever get married?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Monica Lewinsky married?</h2><p>Though Monica has since walked back into the spotlight — on her terms — she is very adamant about one thing. She will not talk about her personal life with the press.</p><p>“You can ask it, but I keep my personal life private," she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People magazine</a> in a 2015 interview. "I think people have known enough about my romantic life for a lifetime."</p><p>The scandal and public scrutiny of Monica's life made it hard for the then-young woman to earn a living. Monica <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">opened up to late-night host John Oliver</a> about the public shaming she received through the years.</p><p>"I couldn't get a job," she said. "Actually, it was interesting because I went to graduate school in 2005 and graduated in 2006 and thought, 'Oh, ok, now I will begin my life. I will put being 'Monica Lewinsky' behind me and move on to be [an] employee. I couldn't find a job or someone would offer me a job for the wrong reasons."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>So, did the activist ever consider changing her name? In Monica's words, no, she didn't.</p><p>"There were several reasons I didn't," she told the host. "First of all, I don't think that it would really even work." She added, "I think it was also a principle that Bill Clinton didn't have to change his name."</p><p>Monica noted the blatant sexism that stemmed from the affair with her moniker constantly being a hot topic. Though she told the host that she is not proud of all of the choices she's made in life, she's proud of the person that she has become.</p><p>"I'm not ashamed of who I am," she said. “As hard as it has been to have that last name sometimes and the pain that I have felt of what it’s meant for other people in my family who have that last name, I am glad I didn’t change it.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: FX</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What is Monica Lewinsky doing today?</h2><p>While Monica maintains a bit of anonymity when it comes to her personal life, she's not afraid to share her side of the story when it comes to her notorious affair with President Clinton.</p><p>Aside from participating in the 2018 A&E documentary, The Clinton Affair, she currently serves as a producer on the FX series Impeachment: American Crime Story, which is based on the book A Vast Conspiracy: The Real Story of the Sex Scandal That Nearly Brought Down a President by Jeffrey Toobin.</p><p>Impeachment: American Crime Story premieres on Sept. 7 on FX.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhforyvtcKaZKWdp567tLfYZqSaqqKesqU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
