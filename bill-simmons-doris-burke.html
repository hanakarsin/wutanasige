Although this will be her first time calling the conference and NBA finals, she's actually been part of the crew covering the Finals since 2009, but as a sideline reporter. Chances are, you've seen her as a major voice behind basketball — and you've probably seen the viral GIF of her expertly dribbling a ball in heels on the court. However, Doris has finally been given the respect she's earned over the last 30 years.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Handles also on point <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/lRLblQlU6p</a></p>— Brent Redmond (@BrentRedmond8) <a href=#>April 22, 2018</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Some are curious: What does Bill Simmons have to say about Doris Burke's role?</h2><p>Bill Simmons, a famed sports analyst for ESPN who went on to start (the now defunct) Grantland.com and then The Ringer, is one of the most well-known voices in sports journalism. So when it was announced that Doris would be calling the conference and NBA Finals for ESPN Radio, many wondered what his reaction would be...especially since he wrote about her in a super sexist, unprofessional light in 2008. "She’s doing a fine job, but does it make me a sexist that I can’t listen to Doris Burke analyze NBA playoff games without thinking, ‘Woman talking woman talking woman talking woman talking&nbsp;...&nbsp;’ the entire time?” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he wrote on ESPN.com in 2008</a>.</p><p>In 2018, Bill tweeted that Doris was a "fantastic analyst" and that it was "embarrassing" that she was still on the sidelines. Backpeddling much?</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Doris is a fantastic game analyst. It’s ridiculous that espn would ever use her as a sideline reporter at this point.</p>— Bill Simmons (@BillSimmons) <a href=#>April 22, 2018</a></figure><p>That was as close to as an apology that Bill ever came in regard to his comment about Doris doing a "fine job" and that he couldn't listen to her without thinking "Woman talking woman talking woman talking." And that's not the first time Bill has said something demeaning about women.&nbsp;</p><p>When writing about the WNBA, Bill once wrote, "I wish the WNBA scores would be banned from all scrolling tickers on ABC and ESPN. I'm tired of subconsciously digesting tidbits like 'Phoenix 52, Sacramento 44 F' and thinking, 'Wait, that was the final score?' before realizing it was the WNBA. Let's just run their scores on NBA TV with pink lettering. And only between the hours of 2:00 am and 7:30 am." &nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Bill Simmons on the WNBA.
