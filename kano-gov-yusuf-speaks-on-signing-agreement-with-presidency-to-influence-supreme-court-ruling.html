I therefore urged the public to dismiss the fallacy being orchestrated by enemies of progress.</p><p>“It is on record that my lord, the justices of the supreme court delivered a landmark Judgment with justice, equity and fairness and largely protect the integrity of the judiciary.</p><p>“The president is a true democrat who will not undermine other political parties in the interest of his party.</p><p>“Let me state and emphatically that Governor Yusuf has no prior agreement with the president.</p><p>“However, the president should rather be appreciated for maintaining neutrality, peace, and stability in Kano.</p><p>“No doubt, the refusal of the president to carry out the wishes of some prominent members of his party has brought about enduring atmosphere in Kano.</p><p>“On this single act, the good people of Kano will continue to appreciate Mr. President and pray for him to succeed in his administration.</p><p>“The governor had several opportunities to meet the president in all of his visits, and the discussions are centred around the development of Kano state.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye5JpZqSZnqR6qLvVZrCuq6WberS8xJqirGWfo3q0tcanoKefXZa0s7HEppynrF2strW0jKmpnquZmbKvr9hmq6hlmaOzrcHEp5qeZaOqvbOxzJ5knKelp8FuvtSloKefXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
