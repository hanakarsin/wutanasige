Well, actually … that’s every day, because they were forced into captivity by a bunch of power-hungry men. Their color-coded wardrobe is designed to put the women in Gilead in their place, both literally and figuratively.</p><p>Having the handmaids in red, wives in blue, aunties in brown, and Marthas rocking off-gray only makes it that much easier for the patriarchy to push its agenda.</p><p>In a 2017 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Vanity Fair</a>, Handmaid’s Tale author <a href=#>Margaret Atwood</a> shared the significance of the colors used throughout the series.</p><p>She said: “Traditional Renaissance color scheme: blue = Virgin Mary. Red = Mary Magdalene + blood + also - used for prisoners of war in WW II Canada as red shows up well against snow! Econowives = stripes (obvious): they have to do all functions. The TV series uses vaguely Nazi brown for the Aunts.”</p><p>The handmaids aren’t donning in any old red, though. That’s where costume designer Ane Crabtree comes in.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Hulu</span><p>Elisabeth Moss as June, Madeline Brewer as Janine</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">‘Handmaid’s Tale’ costume designer Ane Crabtree said “the color red was of the utmost importance.”</h2><p>Using the context given by Margaret, Ane conceptualized the iconic fit worn by hundreds of imprisoned women in Gilead.</p><p>She told Vanity Fair,<strong> </strong>“For The Handmaid’s Tale, the color red was of the utmost importance, so we started there.” Their goal, Ane said, was to “find the perfect shade that would emotionally exemplify a kind of visual lifeblood.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Hulu</span><p>Elisabeth Moss as June Osbourne</p></figure><p>The designer added, “We wanted the handmaids, as they are the fertile women’s tribe of the story, to flow down the streets of Gilead, leaving a long line of red in the midst of the gray of Gilead.”</p><p>“Beyond this, the red is the color of a womb, of a wanton woman, a scarlet kind of mark upon a pious world of dark tones in the visual landscape, and also in a tiny intimate space.”</p><p>The Handmaid’s Tale airs Wednesdays at 9 p.m. EST on Hulu.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOoZKGZnpm6orXDrGSwnZGnerOxww%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
