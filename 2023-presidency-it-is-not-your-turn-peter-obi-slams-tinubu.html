It will not be by my turn, it is nobody’s turn. It must not be by connection. Election next year must be based on character and trust, it must be based on competence.”</p><h2>No Money Was Missing Under My Watch As Governor</h2><p>The LP flagbearer added that there is a need for leaders to fight and be seen to be fighting corruption. He added that during his time as the Anambra State Governor, no money was mising.</p><p>He said, “If a leader is not stealing, and the family around him are not stealing we will reduce corruption by 70 percent. I was Governor for eight years, there is nowhere money is missing.</p><p>“I am in this retreat to listen, let us put it in writing when we succeed, you must be around to say this is what we have agreed on. Even if we don’t achieve 100 percent, we must have made sacrifices.”</p><h2>Nigerians Ready For Real Change</h2><p>The National Chairman of the Labour Party, <strong>Barrister Julius Abure</strong>, pointed out in his welcome address that the APC government has failed Nigerians and the people are ready to vote them out.</p><p>“Our leaders does not have what it takes to drive development. This is what has been lacking, no one is safe, insecurity has taken over something needs to be done and urgently and I am happy Nigerians are ready for the real change not like the APC change in 2015,” he said.</p><h2>We Will Shock Those Who Think We Don’t Have Structure</h2><p>On his part, the president of the Nigerian Labour Congress (NLC), <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Ayuba Wabba</a></strong> stressed that Nigeria must tackle corruption and move from a consuming nation to a producing nation if the country would develop.</p><p>According to him, “we need to go back to production, which will tackle unemployment. Corruption is an organized crime against the Nigerian public.”</p><p>He urged all labour unions to work together and ensure the opportunity to choose the right person in 2023 is not missed, adding that Labour is ready to activate its structures in the 774 local government areas of the country and those saying the party doesn’t have structures will be shocked.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH16e5BsZmtoYmh6sb7ErKCdnZ6Yxm6102agrGWepMFuxc6uqWaspae7brzErZyrZZ%2BXtm6%2Fy5qkrGWknru2rtRo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
