A pretty cool gesture that showed young folks what it's like to do the right thing.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>There must be something special about the month of November and McConaughey that puts the actor in a very giving mood. Because he decided to spend his 48th birthday bringing that same Texas hospitality to Kentucky, where he surprised 4,500 families with Thanksgiving turkeys.</p><p>Thankfully, the Lincoln Lawyer star documented it live on his Facebook page.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>The giveaway is part of McConaughey's Brand Ambassador role with Wild Turkey Bourbon, which is distilled near Lawrenceburg, Kentucky (where McConaughey gave away the frozen Thanksgiving birds).</p><p>People were in love with the actor's kind gesture.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Others thought it was a cool way for the Bourbon manufacturer to give back to the town.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>While others were just wishing they had a turkey delivered by the man himself to their home.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Even though the act can definitely be viewed as PR for Wild Turkey, it's definitely cool that the actor decided to spend his own birthday handing out so many free turkeys to people by hand.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaK6ZmbKwv45rZ2pvX2Z%2BcHyXaG2fhJGrfK6vwqilmq2XnbK6ecGiqa2glJbGbsDUq6KesaM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
