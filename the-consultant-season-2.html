The black comedy thriller currently holds a mediocre 78 percent approval rating on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rotten Tomatoes</a>, but the audience score is much lower at 43 percent. Although fans and critics praise Christoph Waltz's performance, many have criticized the show's writing and pace.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Daniel Fienberg of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Hollywood Reporter</a> wrote: "The Consultant is counting on Waltz as its exclusive source of humor and terror," adding, "however, you're placing that much responsibility on one actor and one character in an eight-episode season, you'd darned well better do something impressive by the end. Or at least interesting. The Consultant does not."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>John Anderson of the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Wall Street Journal</a> said The Consultant "strings us along with unresolved questions, presuming we’ll stay fascinated, in a way that’s become irritatingly common among eight-part series," while our very own Bianca Piazza of <a href=#>Distractify</a> called the show a "cloudy satire suffering from tonal incongruity and half-baked cultural reflections."</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Creator-writer Tony Basgallop pitched 'The Consultant' as a multiple-season show.</h2><p>Following the release of The Consultant, creator and writer Tony Basgallop spoke with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Collider</a> and revealed if he would like to see the show return for a Season 2. When asked if he pitched it as a one-season or multiple-season show, Tony said, "we pitched it very much as this can go on and on, but we were very clear to say that it's not just a continuation. These are chapters."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>He added, "You know, each season should reflect something in itself and stand for something in itself and have its own ending in a sense. What I didn't want to do is just, 'Let's get to the end of every season and have a huge cliffhanger, and then we'll figure out what it is, how we can solve it later in the next season if we're lucky enough.' It very much wasn't that approach."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>"I think, with someone of Christoph’s caliber, we had to reassure him that, 'Look, seasons are whole things. Each one you should look at as a novel in itself.' You know, maybe we'll do a trilogy. Maybe one is enough. Maybe two will be right," Tony continued.</p><p>"I think if the materials are there then we'll continue," he said. "We don't have that same pressure of 10, 20 years ago, of like 'You need 20 episodes a year, you gotta run for five years.' It's just not the marketplace anymore. We don't have to pitch things in that way." Well, we hope to see it return to the small screen for a new installment!</p><p>The Consultant is now streaming on Prime Video.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbWmecKopaytnKmur8CMrJyaq5%2BjenM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
