The assist was his 5th in 18 games in all competitions.</p><p>The assist helped Leicester City to beat West Brom away from home, a victory that pushed them to the first spot in the Championship table with 45 points in 19 games, after 15 wins, one draw, and three defeats.</p><p>Since Ndidi left Belgian Pro League side, KRC Genk for Leicester City in January 2017, the defensive midfielder has never provided more than four assists in a single season.</p><p>While Leicester City was still in the Premier League, Ndidi has had it that good in terms of assists in two different seasons. In the 2017/18 and 2020/21 seasons, the Nigeria international provided four assists, respectively, in all competitions, which were his highest for a single season.</p><p>Hence, his current five assists in all competitions are the highest number of assists Ndidi has ever provided in a single season, and has the potential of having more before the end of the season.</p><p>So far in his spell at Leicester City, Wilfred Ndidi has recorded a total of 17 assists in 255 games in all competitions. With his three goals in the 2023-2024 season, the Nigerian midfielder has now recorded a total of 14 goals for Leicester City.</p><p>The current contract between Wilfred Ndidi and Leicester City who are battling to return to the Premier League ahead of next season, will expire at the end of this season.
