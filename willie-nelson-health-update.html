Here’s a 2024 health update.</h2><p>As of this writing, Willie doesn't seem to be well. In a statement released on his X account on June 21, 2024, it was noted that Willie "is not feeling well" and had been advised by his doctors to sit out for his scheduled performance. The message adds, "he has been advised to rest for the next four days," but offers a silver lining, stating, "he is expected to make a quick recovery and join the Outlaw Music Festival tour next week."</p><p>It continues, "in the meantime, Lukas Nelson and the Family Band, along with a a few guests, will perform a special set to include Willie's classics and other songs."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=zxx dir=ltr><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/EJx7Gt3MVL</a></p>— Willie Nelson (@WillieNelson) <a href=#>June 26, 2024</a></figure><p>Unlike when fans became upset after country singer <a href=#>Morgan Wallen</a> abruptly canceled his concert minutes before he was scheduled to take the stage in 2023, Willie's fans are more understanding, given his age of 91.</p><p>One fan wrote, "I sincerely hope he feels better soon.

His wife, Annie D’Angelo, told the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Times</a> that she and her husband were on tour when his health took a turn for the worse.</p><p>According to her, they were stopped in Nashville, Tenn., when Willie tested positive for COVID-19. With this, he was forced to cancel and postpone a number of shows on his tour.</p><p>“There were a couple of times when I wasn’t sure he was going to make it. I had a pretty rough time with it. COVID ain’t nothing to be laughing at, that’s for sure,” Annie told the outlet.</p><p>Following his recovery, Willie got right back out on stage — but not without his wife putting a few precautions in place first. Along with a mask mandate, everyone (including his bandmates) were required to stay six feet away from the singer on stage.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>“If I have to be the bad guy to keep him safe, I’ll be the bad guy.
