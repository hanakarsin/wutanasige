And while participants can win real money for answering questions, it seems that most folks are more annoyed by the game. The host of <a href=#>TikTok Trivia</a> has especially rubbed people the wrong way.</p><p>So who is the TikTok Trivia host and why are people so upset? Here‚Äôs what TikTokers are saying on the platform about the seemingly intrusive content and its moderator.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Let's meet the TikTok Trivia host.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><p>First, what is TikTok Trivia? For anyone who has not opened their app lately, the trivia game offers participants a share of a $500,000 prize pool.</p><p>James Henry, the TikTok Trivia host, announced the premise on the platform, adding that from Feb. 22‚Äì26, 2023, he would be putting participants‚Äô ‚Äúknowledge to the test for all things TikTok, pop culture, and entertainment.‚Äù The games take place in a series of eight live shows.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@tiktoklive_us href=#>@tiktoklive_us</a><p>Want to get your share of a $500,000 prize pool? @jameshenry will put your knowledge to the test for all things TikTok, pop culture, & entertainment in a series of 8 LIVE shows from Feb. 22-26!

According to his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>, James is not only a <a href=#>mega-influencer</a>, but an actor and comedian. His star is clearly on the rise, as his social media features James taking selfies with the likes of <a href=#>Jennifer Hudson</a> and <a href=#>Kelly Rowland</a>.</p><p>Unfortunately, TikTok Trivia doesn‚Äôt seem to be his calling, since plenty of people are bashing James‚Äôs hosting style online. One particular creator, who posts as I Have a Dog Please Like Me, dedicated a TikTok to bashing James, going out of his way to proclaim that the influencer talks too much during the questions, which he found annoying.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@ihaveadogpleaselikeme href=#>@ihaveadogpleaselikeme</a><p>i'm so mad I wasted 30 minutes of my life today <a title=tiktoktrivia href=#>#tiktoktrivia</a> <a title=trivia href=#>#trivia</a> <a title=hqtrivia href=#>#hqtrivia</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - ihaveadogpleaselikeme" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - ihaveadogpleaselikeme</a></figure><p>This video inspired many commenters to chime in and agree with the creator‚Äôs take on James as a TikTok Trivia host, with one person adding, ‚ÄúAnd he would laugh for no reason!‚Äù Someone else referred to James as ‚Äúinsufferable‚Äù while another TikTok user opined that he was trying too hard and instead of being funny and relatable, was annoying.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">To be fair, it seems that TikTok Trivia in general is what has most people annoyed.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@tiktoklive_us href=#>@tiktoklive_us</a><p>@jameshenry gives us a behind the scenes look at what it takes to play host of TikTokTrivia! üí™ Catch Game 3 today at 5pm PST & watch your favorites on LIVE.</p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - tiktoklive_us" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - tiktoklive_us</a></figure><p>Poor James. He can‚Äôt be blamed for the seeming failure of TikTok Trivia to entertain users. Instead, the game has many folks irritated, with creators saying that when you open the app, pop-ups interrupt your experience every time.</p><p>Many users who decided to join took to James‚Äôs announcement about the game to demand, ‚ÄúHow do I back out?‚Äù and ‚ÄúHow do I unregister?‚Äù Plenty of folks seemed to feel the game was a waste of time and took way too long ‚Äî especially given how long James draws out each question before sharing the answer, ultimately revealing if you‚Äôve won money.</p><p>A few creators went so far as to take the time to make TikToks showing people <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">how to unregister</a> from the game. Other clips accumulated bemoaning how <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TikTok Trivia won‚Äôt go away</a> no matter what you do.</p><p>Ultimately, the good news is that by Feb. 26, the trivia game is over. Hopefully James will move on to another collaboration that goes over better!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqbaswM6kZK2qmau2onnHqKqt</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
