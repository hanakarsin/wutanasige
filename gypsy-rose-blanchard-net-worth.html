Shawn D. Bushway, an economist and criminologist at the RAND Corporation, co-authored a research paper that found when a formerly incarcerated person finds work, "they earn significantly less than their counterparts without criminal history records." Unfortunately it seems as if being released from prison doesn't necessarily mean you're free from imprisonment.</p><p>However, there are always exceptions to every statistic and <a href=#>Gypsy Rose Blanchard</a> appears to be one of them. In December 2023 Blanchard was released from prison after spending over eight years there for her involvement in the murder of her mother Dee Dee Blanchard. Many felt that Blanchard <a href=#>asking her then-boyfriend to murder her abusive mother</a> was an act of self-defense, and now that she's out, her star power has skyrocketed. What is Gypsy Rose Blanchard's net wroth? Here's what we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@gypsyrose_a_blanchard</a><p>Gypsy Rose Blanchard in Central Park</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Gypsy Rose Blanchard's net worth is climbing with seemingly no end in sight.</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">one source</a>, Blanchard's net worth has reached an estimated $ 3 million.

"I feel like I have been blessed with that ability to possibly create change,” she told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People</a> in an exclusive interview in December 2023. “And that is what I'm trying to do."</p><p>Blanchard went on to say that she never wanted to be famous, but she did want to help people with her story.
