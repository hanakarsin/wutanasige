Do you see the way those guys drive??? Did he b@sh the pastor’s car or not? I don’t agree with most of Adefarasin’s doctrines but 90 percent of us in his shoes would have done the same thing. ~FRZ”</p><p>Also reacting to the situation, media personality cum actor, Uti Nwachukwu wrote, “Your mentor sef na human being!! E say na I feel ashamed 😂😂😂 u Neva start… the sooner yall realise that Pastors are Humans like you and I and not GODS, the better for u. Plus Lagos drivers will drive u nuts and bring out the werey in you ! They will hit u and feel entitled to you “Letting it go” just cos they feel you are in a higher position in Life! Na soooo👏👏.
