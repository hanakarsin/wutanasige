Fans also see multiple appearances from Anansa’s mom, supermodel <a href=#>Beverly Johnson</a>.</p><p>During an exclusive interview with Distractify, Matt admitted that being the future son-in-law of fashion royalty was a surreal experience.

However, that all changed when he met Anansa’s mom, Beverly.</p><p>I (hopefully) don’t have to tell you how far Beverly’s résumé stretches. In addition to being the first Black model to grace the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cover of American Vogue</a> and walking countless runways, she is also an accomplished actor. A guest spot on <a href=#>Martin</a> was one of her most iconic roles, as she played Martin’s (<a href=#>Martin Lawrence</a>) treacherous former teacher, Miss Trinidad.</p><p>One of the episode’s quotable scenes was Gina (<a href=#>Tisha Campbell</a>) witnessing Miss Trinidad throw herself at Martin.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@lovequeendna href=#>@lovequeendna</a><p>Reply to @jennii916 this scene? 😂😂 <a title=martinpayne href=#>#martinpayne</a> <a title=martintvshow href=#>#martintvshow</a> <a title=blacksitcoms href=#>#blacksitcoms</a> <a title=comedy href=#>#comedy</a> <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a> <a title=BiggerIsBetter href=#>#BiggerIsBetter</a> <a title=ShowerWithMoxie href=#>#ShowerWithMoxie</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - DJanae Adams" href=#>♬ original sound - DJanae Adams</a></figure><p>Matt exclusively told Distractify that, as a “huge Martin fan,” he had a “fan experience” when he was initially around Beverly. He also shared that his friends — fellow Martin aficionados — were just as starstruck.</p><p>“My homeboys were like, you dating Miss Trinidad's daughter?” Matt said of his friends’ reaction to Beverly.</p><p>“It was just kind of a fan experience,” he continued. “Which is weird for me because I don't get that too often because I'm in the mix and, you know, play with Kobe, and I know Mike [Jordan] and all these big names that people normally fan out about.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@iambeverlyjohnson</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Matt said he now sees Beverly Johnson as “Safta” to his and Anansa’s kids.</h2><p>Matt’s slight infatuation with Beverly and her Miss Trinidad role is now masked by her real-life role as his kids’ “Safta.” Safta is Beverly’s preferred name with the kids and means “grandmother” in Hebrew, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kveller</a>.</p><p>“You hear things about supermodels, but I've always just seen the grandma and a mom to Anansa,” Matt said of Beverly. “The person I picked's mom is one of the biggest supermodels ever. But now she’s just ‘Babs’ or, as the kids call her, ‘Safta.’ Business as usual.”</p><p>The Barnes Bunch airs new episodes on WeTV on Fridays at 10 p.m. EST.</p><p>Reporting done by Pretty Honore.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoq61wIybmKumlah6o7HVnqmlsV2fvKm60qilZqqVoa61tc6nqqGhoA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
