Sometimes, those personal lives need to take precedent over their performance on the field or court. That seems to be exactly what is happening with the <a href=#>NFL</a> Atlanta Falcons’ wide receiver <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Calvin Ridley.</a></p><p>Ahead of the matchup between the Falcons and the Panthers on Sunday, Oct. 31, 2021, the team announced Calvin was dealing with a “personal matter” and would therefore not be playing. Naturally, people started to wonder: What happened to Calvin Ridley?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What happened to Calvin Ridley?</h2><p>Calvin provided a bit of clarification on his social media accounts. He posted a message on both <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a> and Instagram saying that he needs to step away from football for the time being. “These past few weeks have been very challenging and as much as I’d like to be on the field competing with my teammates, I need to step away from football at this time and focus on my mental wellbeing,” he wrote.</p><p>Due to Calvin’s reference to “these past few weeks,” people have been wondering whether something specific happened recently to lead to his temporary departure from the sport. It doesn’t look as though Calvin has shared any information about specific hardships over the past few weeks. That being said, he may just be choosing to keep the details of his personal life private.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=und dir=ltr><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/q7OOoAKkdV</a></p>— CALVIN RIDLEY (@CalvinRidley1) <a href=#>October 31, 2021</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Calvin Ridley was also absent from a game in Week 4 due to a “personal matter.”</h2><p>In Week 4, Calvin didn’t make the trip to <a href=#>London</a> for the game against the Jets. The team announced he’d be absent and also clarified that he had their full support. “We are in support of Calvin during this time and will respect his privacy on the matter,” the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">official statement</a> read. The Falcons went on to win that game, although they lost against the Panthers in Week 8.</p><p>Some of Calvin’s purported fans have taken to social media to complain about his absence, particularly in light of how that absence may affect their <a href=#>Fantasy Football</a> scores. While losing points — both on the field and in a Fantasy league — may be frustrating, that’s obviously not what’s most important to Calvin, his team, and to the people who support him.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Trying to figure out how to handle Calvin Ridley on my dynasty leagues: <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/tniIdHGSII</a></p>— David Zäch (@DavidZach16) <a href=#>November 1, 2021</a></figure><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>To the people complaining about their fantasy teams under this tweet shows exactly why people such as Cavin Ridley don’t ever bring their personal issues to light.

The football season can be grueling even for someone in peak physical and mental condition, so taking a break every now and again can be beneficial to just about everyone. Calvin seems to understand this as well — he said that taking this time to focus on his mental health will “help [him] be the best version of [himself] both now and in the future.”</p><p>We wish Calvin the best and commend him for making his well-being a top priority.</p><p><strong>If you or someone you know needs help, use </strong><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>SAMHSA Behavioral Health Treatment Services Locator</strong></a><strong> to find support for mental health and substance use disorders in your area or call 1-800-662-4357 for 24-hour assistance.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIyhmKmolaOypXnTqGScmZyrtq950aKbpZ2p</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
