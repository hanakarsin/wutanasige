Details.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok/Twitter</span></figure><p>In May of 2007, three-year-old U.K. native <a href=#>Madeleine McCann</a> disappeared from the Portuguese villa that her family was staying in while on vacation. It's been more than 13 years since Madeleine went missing, and the case has continued to captivate the public. Few questions have been answered to provide clarity to her family.</p><p>In June of 2020, a German public prosecutor revealed that a suspect had been identified in the kidnapping, and there was a resurgence of further interest in the investigation.&nbsp;</p><p>The increase in attention for the disappearance spread to the short video app <a href=#>TikTok</a>, and users are now sharing their theories as to what happened. Several people have even gone viral for alleging that they might be Madeleine.&nbsp;</p><p>What is the Madeleine McCann TikTok conspiracy? Some have questioned if it involves <a href=#>Ghislaine Maxwell</a>, while others have come up with their own hunches about the night she went missing. &nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">These Madeleine McCann TikTok conspiracies have gotten a lot of attention online.</h2><p>True crime fans have found a niche on TikTok, and it's become a popular destination for those looking to float their own hypotheses about the world's biggest unsolved crimes.&nbsp;</p><p>On TikTok, #MadeleineMcCann has more than 20.7 million views. Many users have claimed that they are Madeline, who would now be 17 years old.&nbsp;</p><p>One video that got hundreds of thousands of views online was posted by Gabriellea Duncan (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@GabrielleaDuncan</a>). The 19-year-old put up a picture of herself from 2006 when she went on a family vacation to Portugal.&nbsp;</p><p>"My mum showing me a photo of a German man that was obsessed with me in Portugal a year before Madeleine McCann went missing," she wrote. She noted that she resembled Madeleine, and that her mom took notice of her connection to the man.&nbsp;</p><p>The post got a lot of attention because the suspect named in the case is German. In a follow-up video, Gabriellea confirmed that she sent along the information to the police.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@gabrielleaduncan href=#>@gabrielleaduncan</a><p>What the actual hell <a title=waitadamnminute href=#>##waitadamnminute</a> <a title=madeleinemccann href=#>##madeleinemccann</a> <a title=fyp href=#>##fyp</a> <a title=foryoupage href=#>##foryoupage</a> <a title=shook href=#>##shook</a></p><a title="â™¬ original sound - enny.xx" href=#>â™¬ original sound - enny.xx</a></figure><p>A conspiracy that has gotten a lot of traction on TikTok is that only one of the suspect sketches for the case over time has been a woman.
