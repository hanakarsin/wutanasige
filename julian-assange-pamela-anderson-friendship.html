Julian is best known as the founder of Wikileaks and became well known in the 2010s for revealing a variety of highly sensitive state secrets.</p><p>Following the news of his release, many began to learn more about who Julian actually is. Among the strangest details about his life, though, is the fact that he has been friends with <a href=#>Pamela Anderson</a> for some time. Here's what we know about that friendship and how it got started.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Pamela Anderson discusses Julian Assange's extradition with his lawyer in April of 2024.</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Pamela Anderson and Julian Assange's friendship has lasted more than a decade.</h2><p>According to Pamela's 2023 memoir, she and Julian were first introduced in 2014 by fashion designer <a href=#>Vivienne Westwood</a>. Julian was living in the Ecuadorian embassy in the United Kingdom at the time, and Pamela would regularly bring him vegan meals. Julian was reportedly interested in her "perspective on global issues."</p><p>They initially tried to keep the friendship quiet, but the press eventually caught on after Pamela's repeated trips to the embassy.</p><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">People,</a> Pamela said that Julian had taught her a lot.</p><p>"We talk about the world," she said. "He’s a very good teacher. Julian is one of my favorite people. He is a refugee. He might be the most famous refugee of our time — famous for being persecuted."</p><p>"He’s a good person who cares about the world,” she added. “He is a kind and deeply empathetic person. He is funny, sensitive, romantic, surprisingly resourceful. He’s a good man."</p><p>Some even speculated that the two may have a romantic relationship following the interview.</p><p style=text-align:start>"Julian is trying to free the world by educating it. It is a romantic struggle — I love him for this," she said. "I understand that our 'affair' and the curiosity surrounding that might bring some attention to his situation. That’s fine, but I’d rather not go into private details. Let’s just say everyone deserves love."</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>“He does not deserve to be in a super max prison... he is an innocent person” - <a href=#>@pamelaanderson</a> speaking in 2019 after a visit to Julian</p><p>Today marks 5 years of Julian Assange's incarceration in Belmarsh.

"My car was still waiting outside, and I’m sure that sent some tongues wagging. We joked about getting hitched on the front steps of the embassy — maybe then they wouldn’t arrest him?"</p><p>Julian has since married his partner Stella, but Pamela remained an outspoken advocate for Julian throughout his time in the embassy and in British prison.</p><p>"He deserved our support because he has sacrificed so much to bring the truth out and we deserve the truth. That is all I can say. I am sorry, I feel sick, I feel nauseous. We are here to save his life, that is what this is," she told reporters.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfn8KttcCnZJqro5a7qLGMqZimnZyWeqK6w56prKeeYrOztcSnm6ygmaU%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
