Unfortunately, that didn't wind up happening (it earned a blasphemous Rotten Tomatoes score of 43 percent).</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>As for the series, it loosely follows a plan of one book per season.</p><p>"Largely it's one book per season . . . [but] there are a few treats I've stolen from other books," Jack Thorne said at Television Critics' Association panel in 2019, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">IGN</a>. "The whole story of three books and how can we celebrate them in the best possible way, and sometimes that involved moving certain elements forward."</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p><span>Source: YouTube/HBO</span></figure><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>HBO also confirmed that Season 3 —&nbsp;which premiered on Dec. 5, 2022 — follows the events of The Amber Spyglass.</p><p>"The final chapter of this epic fantasy series finds Lyra (Dafne Keen) and Will (Amir Wilson) on a journey to a dark place from which no one has ever returned.
