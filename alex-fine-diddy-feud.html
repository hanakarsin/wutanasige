Guess you got a new agenda with someone you barely know. I won’t say you’re wrong. Guess you had to move on,” Diddy sings in the song. Hours after Diddy released the song, Alex took to Instagram to post a message that some believe was directed at the artist.</p><p>“Happy Pride to all my LGBTQ+ friends,” Alex wrote on his Instagram Story (via <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Neighborhood Talk</a>). Adding, “Attached is a charity that helps people who are in the closet and GOTTA MOVE ON. Along with other resources.”</p><p>And while Alex didn't mention Diddy in the post, it seemed to spark the beginning of their feud.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by The Neighborhood Talk (@theneighborhoodtalk)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">The feud between Alex and Diddy has been a bit more one sided so far.</h2><p>Diddy never responded to the message Alex shared on Instagram, but that didn't stop the fitness enthusiast from taking another jab at the legendary hip-hop producer. In September, Diddy stopped by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Breakfast Club</a> and announced that he would be giving artists previously signed with Bad Boy Records the publishing rights to their songs.</p><p>“You don't have to make changes in the world, but if you have a chance to do the right thing, you do the right thing,” Diddy exclaimed. “That's a world I want to live in. I want to be the change that I want.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by The Neighborhood Talk (@theneighborhoodtalk)</a></p></figure><p>However, Alex wasn't happy with Diddy’s sudden change of heart and took a shot at the mogul online. “He's so old n' fruity,” Alex commented under a video of Diddy on Instagram, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Radar Online.</a></p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Cassie claims Diddy was abusive during their relationship.</h2><p>Alex’s feud with Diddy shows no signs of ending. Cassie has since filed a lawsuit against her ex-boyfriend, claiming that he was sexually abusive to her during their time together. In court documents filed on Nov. 16, 2023, Cassie alleged that she was subject to years of physical, psychological, and sexual abuse while dating Diddy.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>“After years in silence and darkness, I am finally ready to tell my story, and to speak up on behalf of myself and for the benefit of other women who face violence and abuse in their relationships,” Cassie said in a statement obtained by the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Associated Press</a>.</p><p>Diddy, through his attorney, vehemently denied the accusations and suggested that Cassie attempted to blackmail the music mogul before she filed her lawsuit.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflrmmxIyfoKedXZm2pbDYZp2erZQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
