The 25-year-old singer and social media personality operating under the handle <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">@bellapoarch</a> is very popular on the platform.</p><p>Up until recently, she had the most-liked video of all time with 64 million likes in 2020. But unfortunately, she was just surpassed by<strong> </strong><a href=#>Lionel Messi</a>, who amassed more than 71 million likes on a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">photo carousel</a> of his World Cup victory.</p><p>Still, we must remember that Bella held the record for the most-liked social media post for more than two years. That must have brought in a lot of dough for her, right? Keep reading as we take a look at Bella's net worth.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: getty images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Bella Poarch's net worth isn't actually that high, apparently.</h2><p>Being a TikTok star pays well, but exactly how much? The influencer, who previously <a href=#>served in the U.S. Navy</a>, currently has more than 92.5 million followers and has accumulated more than 2.2 billion likes on her videos. That sounds pretty steep, if you ask us.</p><p>And given that other TikTok-famous stars like <a href=#>Charli</a> and <a href=#>Dixie D'Amelio</a> have net worths in the millions, you would assume that Bella would pull similar numbers. But according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebs Life Reel</a>, Bella only has an estimated net worth of $200,000 to $300,000.</p><p class="sc-eEVlDD iAFcKh"><span>Bella Poarch</span></p><p class="sc-jlZIZy iWVnnf">Singer, Social Media Personality</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $200,000</p><p>Bella Poarch is a Filipino-born American singer and TikTok personality who is best known for her "M to the B" viral video.</p><p style=text-align:start><strong>Birthdate:</strong> Feb. 9, 1997</p><p style=text-align:start><strong>Birthplace: </strong>Philippines</p><p style=text-align:start><strong>Birth name:</strong> Denarie Taylor</p><p style=text-align:start><strong>Marriages:</strong> Tyler Poarch (2019-2022, divorced)</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What was Bella Poarch's viral video?</h2><p>The "M to the B" video that made Poarch a TikTok star now has more than 60 million likes. In the 10-second video below, she bobs her head, crosses her eyes, and makes silly faces to a song by British rapper Millie B. The video has received a lot of love from adoring fans, but at the same time, many folks in the comments struggled to see what was so great about it.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@bellapoarch href=#>@bellapoarch</a><p>To the üêù üêù üêù <a title=fyp href=#>#fyp</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ M to the B - Millie B" href=#>‚ô¨ M to the B - Millie B</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why is Bella Poarch famous?</h2><p>Bella is famous because of her mountainous following on social media. But it has become clear that she's not everyone's cup of tea.</p><p>Back in 2020, <a href=#>Bella was under fire for getting a Rising Sun tattoo</a> on her body. Many of her Korean fans found the tattoo offensive as the Rising Sun flag symbol is an image that dates back to Japan's occupation of Korea and is reminiscent of a long list of war crimes and oppression.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I apologize to Koreans because 6 months ago I got a tattoo of the red sun with 16 rays. At that time, I didn‚Äôt know the history. But when I found out, I immediately had it covered and scheduled for removal. I am ashamed of myself for not doing my research. I sincerely apologize.</p>‚Äî Bella Poarch (@bellapoarch) <a href=#>September 6, 2020</a></figure><p>However, Bella did make amends by removing the tattoo after learning more about the history behind it. The creator was also in hot water after referring to her friend from the Navy, who was a person of color, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">as Harambe</a>.</p><p>Harambe is also the name of a gorilla who was shot dead at the Cincinnati Zoo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7KtuMBmp6iZopi1brrErWSwp6KptQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
