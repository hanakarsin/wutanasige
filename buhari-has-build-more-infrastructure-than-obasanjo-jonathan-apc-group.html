It is no coincidence that the last time Nigeria saw an infrastructure revolution on this scale was during the period, in the late 1990s, when the president ran the Petroleum Trust Fund (PTF).</p><p>“Beyond the focus on completing inherited and abandoned projects, the Buhari administration has creatively unlocked public and private sector financing for infrastructure in Nigeria, through such initiatives as the Presidential Infrastructure Development Fund (PIDF), the Infrastructure Company (InfraCo), the Highway Development Management Initiative (HDMI), the Sovereign Sukuk Bonds (that have collectively raised close to a billion dollars), and the Infrastructure Tax Credit Scheme.</p><p>“Between them, these initiatives cover thousands of kilometres of critical roads and will mobilise several billions of dollars in public and private financing.</p><p>“This week, the president will commission the 156km Lagos-Ibadan standard gauge rail, the first double-track standard gauge rail project in West Africa (and the first standard gauge rail project in Nigeria to be started and completed by the same administration).</p><p>“This landmark commissioning is taking place nine months after he commissioned the 327km Itakpe-Warri standard gauge rail, completed by his administration 33 years after construction began.</p><p>“The 168km Abuja-Kaduna rail project, and the 42.5km Abuja light rail project, both inherited from previous administrations, were completed in 2016 and 2018, respectively.</p><p>“The second Niger bridge, originally conceived decades ago, is now more than 50 percent completed, and scheduled for commissioning in 2022, as is the Lagos-Ibadan expressway, which has defied every administration since 1999.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH13e49xZputmJa%2FqnnHmqpmmqWeuaV5zKipnmWZo7OzrdKtqa6bpKq%2FpnnToZinZZ%2BXrrStzaOmZqKfo661tMCnZJqok2K0s7vUqWY%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
