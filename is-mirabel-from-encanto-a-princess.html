The film follows a young girl named Mirabel Madrigal whose family members all have magical abilities. Well, all of them besides her. It really takes a hit to her self-esteem in the beginning. Later on, she finds out that the magic is in danger and she could be its only hope.</p><p>Based on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the trailer</a>, Encanto looks like it has all the magical wonder we have all come to love and expect from Disney movies. But does that mean Mirabel is a princess? Here's what we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Disney</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Mirabel from 'Encanto' a princess?</h2><p>According to the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Encanto Fandom</a>, Mirabel Madrigal is a princess, but it's not clear exactly how. She grows up with her family in a magical town named Encanto. It's hidden away in the mountains of Colombia, and since Mirabel is only a teenager, it's not likely that Disney would let her marry a prince.</p><p>On top of that, Mirabel doesn't seem to come from a royal bloodline. Her mother, Julieta, is a doctor. She uses her gift to heal others. Mirabel's father is Agust√≠n. He married into the magic of the family so it could be his fault that his youngest daughter doesn't have any powers.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Mirabel is the first Disney princess to wear glasses.</h2><p>It may seem like a small win, but Mirabel is the first Disney princess and the first female protagonist to wear glasses. Only a small number of leads from the magical content powerhouse have worn glasses previously: Milo Thatch from Atlantis, Doc from <a href=#>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</a>, and The White Rabbit from Alice in Wonderland are a few examples from more classic movies.</p><p>Meg Murry from <a href=#>A Wrinkle in Time</a>, and Sadness from Inside Out are more recent ones. But none of them are princesses.</p><p>For people who wear glasses, Mirabel doing the same is very important. In early 2019, the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">BBC</a> reported that a fan wondered why there's a lack of specks in these movies. A young girl named Lowri wrote a letter to the company asking that there be a princess who's got some frames.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>"Please may you make a Disney princess with glasses," Lowri wrote. "I feel like there's lots of girls who wear glasses and I don't want them to feel like I did. Sadly, most of the characters who wear glasses are called geeks and I don't think that's fair."</p><p>Afterward, a Disney spokesperson responded to Lowri's letter. "Disney holds a special place in the hearts of millions of people. ... Our stories are timeless because they speak to the heart," the company said.</p><p>"Disney remains committed to continuing to create characters that are accessible and relatable to all children."</p><p>Encanto is coming to theaters on Nov. 24, 2021, and will reportedly begin streaming on <a href=#>Disney Plus</a> on Dec. 24, 2021.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuucirmJudnGKzs7vMZpynm5GjwbB5wGanq6GemLK0vw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
