Without further delay, here’s who got engaged in The Ultimatum: Queer Love.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who gets engaged in ‘The Ultimatum: Queer Love’?</h2><p>It’s no secret each set of couples in <a href=#>The Ultimatum</a> spin-off had their issues. With Yoly torn between her partner of three years, Mal, and her trial wife of three weeks, Xander, viewers knew her situation would end in heartbreak for at least one person.</p><p>However, the verdict couldn’t have been more surprising. After revealing that she was still in love with Xander before Mal’s proposal in the eighth episode, Yoly ultimately said yes to her original partner.</p><p>But where did that leave <a href=#>Xander and her girlfriend, Vanessa</a>? After the duo’s toxic relationship played out on-screen, fans will be happy knowing that Xander parted ways with her high school sweetheart during the finale.</p><p>Despite Vanessa being the ultimatum receiver, Xander finally realized that they were on separate pages and that marriage was not the answer for either.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>My exact facial expression when Aussie gave Sam that rock<a href=#>#TheUltimatumQueerLove</a> <a href=#>#TheUltimatum</a> <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/LjUu1rr5S9</a></p>— Asia McMahon (@AsiaLanier) <a href=#>June 7, 2023</a></figure><p>Surprisingly, Xander and Vanessa were the only original couple who did not get engaged by the show’s conclusion.</p><p>In the finale, Aussie proposed to Sam, a relatively shocking occurrence considering Aussie’s avoidant communication style. However, Sam was overjoyed when her partner presented her with a real engagement ring after jokingly offering her a heart-shaped crystal.</p><p>Before the finale, Mildred and Tiff significantly progressed their relationship — with a few exceptions — so Tiff’s heartfelt proposal wasn’t entirely unexpected.</p><p>The pair ended happily engaged at the time of filming (we can’t emphasize “at the time of filming” enough, though). That leaves our final couple: Lexi and Rae. In a shocking turn of events, both women propose to one another after a rocky start in the reality series and end the finale engaged.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Is anyone from ‘The Ultimatum: Queer Love’ married now?</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p>Despite four of the five original couples leaving The Ultimatum: Queer Love engaged, none of the cast members made it down the aisle by the 2023 reunion. Additionally, only one previously engaged couple is still together today: <a href=#>Aussie and Sam</a>.</p><p>Since filming wrapped in 2021, <a href=#>Mal and Yoly</a>, <a href=#>Lexi and Rae</a>, and <a href=#>Mildred and Tiff</a> have all gone their separate ways — some on worse terms than others.</p><p>Almost every cast member from Season 1 of The Ultimatum: Queer Love is single after their time on the LGBTQ+ reality series, aside from Lexi, who is now dating someone who “gives [her] all of the love and happiness [she] felt with Mal,” according to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Netflix</a>.</p><p>The Ultimatum: Queer Love is now streaming on Netflix.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWwecaeq6xllaO0orPEnWStoJViwq3AyKaYra2dYr62scSrZKWnppo%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
