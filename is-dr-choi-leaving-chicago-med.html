Then, herniated lumbar discs kept Ethan out of the operating room until Episode 12 of Season 7 where, upon his return, he lost his father.</p><p>Now in Season 8, things haven't been looking good for Dr. Choi. <a href=#>Is he leaving Chicago Med?</a></p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Is Dr. Choi leaving 'Chicago Med'?</h2><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">TVLine</a>, Brian Tee's Dr. Ethan Choi is leaving Chicago Med in the Dec. 7 episode, which is also the show's fall finale. While this is obviously devastating news, it's somewhat bittersweet as Ethan is definitely going out with a bang, or rather a bell. That's right! It's <a href=#>wedding bells for Ethan and April</a> with the hospital staff as guests.</p><p>When April and Ethan met again at his father's grave, it helped solidify things for Ethan. The passing of his father gave Ethan some perspective into his relationship with April that has made things "easier this time around." The wedding might feel quick for everyone at Gaffney Medical Center, but it was a foregone conclusion once April and Ethan realized that neither of them had really moved on since they last saw each other.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: NBC</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Does this mean April Sexton is also leaving 'Chicago Med'?</h2><p>If Ethan's exit is tied to his marriage to April, we have to assume that where he goes, she goes. When <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Variety</a> announced actress Yaya DaCosta would be reprising her role as April Sexton for Season 8, it was only for a recurring part.</p><p>Chicago Med co-showrunners Andrew Schneider and Diane Frolov have been pretty open about their willingness to have characters come back from time to time. This is why Ethan and April are getting such a <a href=#>grand sendoff</a>.</p><p>"We were talking about what we want it to do story-wise, particularly with Ethan and resolving that relationship," said Diane. "We never really got to finish it. We really wanted to, so we reached out to see if [Yaya] would come back for this."</p><p>Yaya was happy to do it. So who knows, maybe Ethan and April will come back on occasion.</p><p>Chicago Med airs on Wednesdays at 8:00 p.m. ET on NBC.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBusNFmmqGnmWK5pq3VoqWgZZOdtqStxqhkpp2U</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
