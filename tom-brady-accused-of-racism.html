This is especially true during the Super Bowl. Voices are raised, trash talk is laid down, and it can get downright ugly. However, Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback <a href=#>Tom Brady</a> reportedly crossed a line on Feb. 7, 2021 â€” and he was even <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">accused of racism</a> during <a href=#>Super Bowl</a> LV.</p><p>So what happened between Tom and Kansas City Chiefs star Tyrann Mathieu?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Tom Brady was accused of racism during Super Bowl LV, but what happened?</h2><p>During the Super Bowl on Sunday, Feb. 7, cameras caught Tom and Tyrann in a heated exchange on more than one occasion â€” presumably engaging in typical trash talk that happens among players. The Buccaneers went on to win the game 31-9, and fans mostly forgot it.</p><p>"It's football," Tyrann said after the Chiefs lost.

"Go back to my previous games against TB12 I showed him nothing but respect. Look at my interviews about him ... I show grace."</p><p>Although Tyrann didn't get into the specifics of what, exactly, Tom called him, some people were quick to assume the Buccaneers quarterback used a racial slur during the Super Bowl altercation. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Sources later confirmed</a> that Tom sent a text message to Tyrann apologizing for the trash talk. But reportedly, their exchange of words had nothing to do with a racist comment from Tom, according to the sources.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>Tom Brady and Tyrann Mathieu talking trash <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/NHZCcmVhyu</a></p>â€” NFL Update (@MySportsUpdate) <a href=#>February 8, 2021</a> <span>Source: Twitter</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Twitter users accused Tom Brady of racism for winning another Super Bowl during Black History Month.</h2><p>Apart from Tom and Tyrann butting heads during the Super Bowl, some people took to Twitter following the big game to declare that Tom's team winning was racist â€” simply because it happened during Black History Month.</p><p>One Twitter user (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">who later clarified they were joking</a>) wrote, "Patrick Mahomes half black right?
