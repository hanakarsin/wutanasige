Here’s where we’ve seen her before.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>NBC’s medical drama <a href=#>New Amsterdam</a> is welcoming its newest cast member, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Frances Turner</a>. She’s joining the cast as a recurring character in Season 3 and is sure to stir up some drama as Dr. Lyn Malvo. Luckily for us, Frances is a familiar face and has been on our screens before.</p><p>We’re super excited to see Frances in her new role, and with all the developments currently underway in <a href=#>New Amsterdam</a>, adding in a new face is sure to exacerbate the already existing drama. It’s said she will have a “complicated relationship” with Dr. Reynolds, so we’re eager to see what that looks like.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: getty images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Frances Turner is playing Dr. Lyn Malvo in ‘New Amsterdam.’</h2><p>Deadline reported that Frances will be joining the cast of New Amsterdam in Season 3, Episode 8, as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. Lyn Malvo</a>. According to Deadline, she will be “the new Chair of the OB department. Malvo will have a 'complicated' friendship with Dr. Reynolds (Jocko Sims) this season.”&nbsp;</p><p>Could this mean a new love triangle with Dr. Reynolds? Now that Evie is seemingly out of the picture, his relationship with Lauren seems up in the air. Now, we’re adding in Dr. Lyn Malvo, and it seems like this “complicated” friendship could mean another love triangle for Floyd, and honestly, we’re on board with that.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">We’ve seen Frances Turner on television before she joined ‘New Amsterdam.’</h2><p>Frances’s turn as Dr. Lyn Malvo is not her first rodeo. She’s most known for her role as Bell Mallory in The Man in the High Castle and as Paula Turner in The Gifted. However, she’s been appearing in television and movies as early as 2006, so it’s exciting to see her in a new recurring role. Her first couple of roles were in The Situation and Law & Order.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Frances (@franceslea25)</a></p></figure><p>Not only that, but Frances has some exciting new projects on her docket as well.
