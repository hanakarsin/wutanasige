We Sure Hope So (SPOILERS)</h1>By <a rel=author href=# class="sc-jYKDjX hHZJHw">Sara Belcher</a><p class="sc-bxLYvs cnDLfX">Updated Feb. 27 2020, 8:03 p.m. ET</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><p><strong>Spoilers for Season 1 of </strong><strong>I Am Not Okay With This</strong><strong>.</strong></p><p>Stranger Things fans have been keeping themselves busy with Netflix's newest supernatural teen show. I Am Not Okay With This dropped on the streaming service on Feb. 26. Following teenage <a href=#>Syndey Novak</a> (Sophia Lillis) as she navigates the typical dilemmas of high school while also dealing with the struggles of her newfound supernatural powers, I Am Not Okay With This is more than your typical, quirky teen drama.</p><p>Fans have already binged all of the episodes and are anxiously waiting for any news of a second season. But with the show being so new, details on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Season 2</a> are sparse, but we have some thoughts as to what could be next for this group of teens.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Will there be a Season 2 of 'I Am Not Okay With This'?</h2><p>Since the show just dropped on the streaming platform, it's too soon to know if there will be a second season. However, given the twist, cliffhanger ending of Season 1, a Season 2 was definitely implied at the time of its release.</p><p>It's likely that Netflix is waiting to see how the show performs before officially announcing a second season, but we're betting that announcement isn't far off. Netflix has signed on sequel seasons of other hit originals, like <a href=#>The Witcher</a> and <a href=#>Stranger Things,</a> before or just as the first season is released.</p><p>The premise for I Am Not Okay With This was based off a graphic novel of the same name by Charles Forsman. If his name sounds familiar, it's because he also wrote the graphic novel, <a href=#>The End of the F***ing World</a>, which was also adapted for a Netflix series.</p><p>Unfortunately, there isn't a sequel to his novel, which means there isn't a guarantee the story will continue. However, <a href=#>the ending of the show differed greatly from that of the book</a>, meaning there's definitely more for the writers to work within a potential Season 2.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Netflix</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who will be returning for Season 2?</h2><p>It's almost guaranteed that our star trio, Syd, Dina, and Stanley will be returning for a potential Season 2. It's likely the rest of the cast will also be making another appearance — except for Brad. You know — the guy who had his head blown off during the season. He's the only confirmed death from Season 1, so everyone else seems to have the green light to return.</p><p>Since a second season would also allow for new content, you can likely expect new characters to be introduced in Season 2.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">When does Season 2 come out?</h2><p>Since it has yet to be confirmed that a second season will happen, we likely won't see the cast return to the show for at least another year, maybe longer. There was a year and a half between Seasons 1 and 2 of Stranger Things, and it'll be another year before we see a second season of The Witcher. Since all of these shows were renewed within days of their first seasons being released, Season 2 likely won't be released until late 2021 at earliest.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnnqiuYynpq1ln6CuunnWoquhZaSdtrR50p6YrKeeYn8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
