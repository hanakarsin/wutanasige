The other cost is that borrowings may continue and things may be difficult fiscally for both the state and the federal government. You know how much could have been saved if the subsidy was removed and how it could have been diverted to other spheres of our lives…we have to pay a price.”</p><p>Petrol currently sells for between N162 and N165/litre in Nigeria but once subsidy is removed, the price will shoot up and is expected to have a ripple effect on the price of other commodities in the country and the economy as well.</p><p>Recently, a report emerged which claimed the National Economic Council (NEC) led by Vice President <strong>Yemi Osinbajo</strong>, has recommended ₦302/litre as the new price of petrol in Nigeria.</p><p>It said that it is part of the plan of the Federal Government to deregulate the prices of Premium Motor Spirit (PMS) and eliminate monthly subsidy payments with provisions to ensure fair competition in the market.</p><p>But speaking on the matter, the spokesperson for the Vice President, <strong>Mr. Laolu Akande</strong> stated last Wednesday that at no time did his principal or NEC <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>make such a resolution or recommendation</a></strong> to the federal government.</p><p>He added that discussions are still ongoing on the issue of fuel subsidy removal in the country and the claim in the viral report should be disregarded by Nigerians.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH1ye5FvZqehl5q%2Fqq2MsKClpF2drrexjK2mZqiRrnqiec%2BroJydXZfCqa3RomSgp6aperS8xJqirGWfo3qpu9Zmq6hll5rBbrLUp5uippdis7C%2BjJ%2BsnqRdqMKjv8idsGaoka66prrTaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
