Addie said she was initially mad at her mom and thought it was her fault that her dad was in trouble. In her interview, Leah admitted that hearing her daughter blame her for her dad being in legal trouble "hurt." However, she said she "had to do what I needed to do" to protect her family and herself, though she wishes it didn't happen in front of their daughter.</p><p>"It's really challenging to try and have a relationship with a toxic ex when you have a child that definitely loves them," Leah explained in her confessional. "I mean, it definitely hurts that Addie would think that I would do something that would hurt her dad, but I know that I did what I needed to do."</p><p>"I believe in being honest with Addie," she added. "I think she's very smart. But even though she's very smart, she's still a kid and really should not be experiencing any of this."</p><p>As of this writing, Leah and Jeremy's court proceedings are ongoing. The exes married in October 2011 and only had their daughter Addie during their marriage. Leah is also a mom to twins Ali and Aleeah, with whom she shares with her first husband, Corey Simms.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfobKitIymnKyrlad6q7HRnqSyZZOWubex0a1kqaqfqbKkwMiopWanopmysw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
