The very thing he built his career on, being a relatable and accepting megachurch pastor, was something critics targeted him for long before he started rubbing elbows with top tier celebrities. But when the church released a statement about Carl being fired, his critics and even his fans wondered what happened.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Why was Carl Lentz fired?</h2><p>On Nov. 4, 2020, Hillsong Church founder Brian Houston released a statement announcing <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Carl Lentz’s termination</a> from his position as a pastor at the congregation’s church in New York.</p><p>"Today Hillsong Church East Coast advised our congregation that we have terminated the employment of Pastor Carl Lentz," Houston said in the statement. "This action was not taken lightly and was done in the best interests of everyone, including Pastor Carl."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>The announcement mentioned "breaches of trust" and "a recent revelation of moral failures" in relation to Carl’s actions as a pastor. And, for some, it comes as little surprise. Fellow Christians have been criticizing his beliefs and gospel over the years, calling him out on YouTube for preaching false statements about the Bible and about Christianity in general. For some, it was a long time coming.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Rumors are circulating that Carl Lentz had an affair.</h2><p>Carl’s wife, fellow pastor Laura Lentz, is also part of Hillsong Church. And with the statement noting trust issues and "moral failures" on Carl’s part, some thought his firing had to do with having an affair.</p><p>Carl took to Instagram to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">admit to infidelity</a>, which makes sense, given his morals being called into question by the church.</p><p>"I was unfaithful in my marriage, the most important relationship in my life and held accountable for that," he wrote. "This failure is on me, and me alone and I take full responsibility for my actions." He added, "This failure is on me, and me alone and I take full responsibility for my actions. I now begin a journey of rebuilding trust with my wife, Laura and my children and taking real time to work on and heal my own life and seek out the help that I need."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">He has been linked to high-profile celebrities like Justin Bieber.</h2><p>There are celebrity chefs and celebrity lifestyle coaches, so obviously, there is now such a thing as celebrity pastors. And, unlike the televangelists of the 90s, who took up time slots at 4 and 6 a.m. on TV, Carl has seemed to pride himself on his relationships with celebrities, thereby giving himself celebrity status of his own.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>We tested out one of our new @hillsongnyc “house party” ideas and it went well!! More importantly, this should be what our reaction is to the Romans 8:28 reminder... “And we know that God causes everything to work together for the good of those who love God and are called according to his purpose for them.” We don’t always get to choose what happens to us, but we can control what we are believing for and what we are saying while we walk through it. “I’m getting better” isn’t empty motivational self talk, it’s a truthful confession if you believe God never stops workin on us! #occupyallstreets #missedyouIGFAM</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Carl Lentz</a> (@carllentz) on Aug 13, 2020 at 5:56pm PDT</p></figure><p>His now-former church in New York City has been attended by the likes of Selena Gomez and Kourtney Kardashian and Carl has been seen in public with Justin Bieber on more than one occasion. He also appeared on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Logan Paul’s podcast</a> once where he spoke about Jesus and his belief system, which was critiqued by plenty of other pastors.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">What does "moral failure" mean?</h2><p>One of the reasons for Carl being fired was something called "moral failure." According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ChurchLeaders.com</a>, some definitions of moral failure in ministry include pride, dishonesty, malicious dissension and, yes, adultery. Carl's actions within his marriage, and now his admission of those actions, certainly fall under that umbrella.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLWiwIydoJ1lk5a%2FrXnLnqWtsl2ZvA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
