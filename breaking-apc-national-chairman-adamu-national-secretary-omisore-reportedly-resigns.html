It is now unclear what will become of these meetings.</p><p>Previously, these same meetings were postponed from last week to July 17, 18, and 19 due to internal disputes and intra-party politics.</p><p>Sources said the NWC and the President had no clear agenda for these meetings, leading to their postponement. This lack of direction is allegedly due to Adamu.</p><p>Reports also indicate a unanimous agreement within the NWC supporting the mandatory resignations of both the National Chairman and his Secretary.</p><p>Additionally, there is purported discontent over alleged ambiguity in the party’s 2022 account audit, which was reportedly “concluded and submitted without any of the members reviewing it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH14e5BvZpuqlZa4qrrGZpipm12jrrW1zqeYpWWTna6qvsyapWaZlJa6tnnNmquip56WuW6%2FxJypnqyRp8Zuu8yiqqiqlWK%2FprzOq6uenJyuerOx0qKep6tf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
