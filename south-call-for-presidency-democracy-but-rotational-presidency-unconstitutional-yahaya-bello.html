It is only a plus for us as youths to be calling on Governor Bello to come and be the number one person in Nigeria.”</p><p>“The agitation is part of democracy, everybody has the right to call for what they want and it is their opinion. But we know that as a party, in the APC, we don’t have any fixed law saying anybody is entitled to power in any area for a period of time. Let the youth of Nigeria decide who they want,” he said</p><p>“If they have seen the youth in Governor Bello, if they have seen a leader and a unifier of the country in him, then he shall be President by the grace of God, because man proposes, but God has the final say.</p><p>“When elected President of Nigeria, Governor Bello will be doing a lot differently, because he has been doing that. The nation is just getting back from Coronavirus and economic recession and you can see Kogi was rated fastest growing economy in Nigeria within that period of time.</p><p>“This means Governor Bello is a man who sees beyond ordinary and taken advantage of circumstances. I believe this is the kind of person we want in Nigeria now, someone with passion for the country someone who is a unifier and has fought against insecurity. We need a leader with commitment to protecting lives and properties of Nigerians,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH16e5FrZqynpam1bq%2FApaNmnp%2BnerG%2BxKygnZ2emMZusMSmppyqkZjGbq7UrWSrp6SWwaq7zZqjZqiimsCqsMSnmrJlpaOwsLrSraCtraSevK%2Bty2awmqCRrq5ursSlo6hn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
