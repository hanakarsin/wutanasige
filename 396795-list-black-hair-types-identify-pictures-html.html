Black women generally have type 4 hair. Type 4 natural hair is generally known as kinky hair that has three hair texture types. Here is a list of black hair types:</p><h3>4A hair type</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/40ea435fc956fd58.jpg><p class=align-left>Top on the list of black women hair types is 4A hair type. This hair type is easy to identify as it has a well-defined curl pattern. The strands form a clearly <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">S-shaped curl pattern </a>with spirals. 4A hair has a fine or wiry texture. It has very few cuticle layers compared to other hair types.</p><p class=align-left>Therefore, it is very fragile and breaks easily because of poor natural protection. The hair type has a very high density, and it appears darker than other black hair types. 4A hair is prone to dryness, but its moisture retention capacity is higher compared to other type 4 hair types.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e2ef86edb0d61104.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>30+ best sisterlocks hairstyles designs and ideas to try</span></p></a><p class=align-left>If you have this type of hair, you need to go for the wash and go hairstyles. A curling cream with a leave-in moisturizer is a must for adding more moisture to daily wash-and-go styling.</p><p class=align-left>You need to use shampoos that contain jojoba oil and tee tree oil when washing your hair. The other recommended products for this hair type are butters and products rich in cream.</p><h3>4B hair type</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/86e360253fddc796.jpg><p class=align-left>4B hair is second on the list of African American hair types. This hair type has a fluffy cotton-like appearance. 4B hair feels wiry when touched, and it is tightly coiled. It does not have a clearly defined curl pattern, but the hair strands have a Z shape. The Z shape is formed by the sharp bends that the hair takes instead of forming a curve.</p><p class=align-left>The texture of 4B hair is very diverse as it ranges from fine texture to a coarse texture. Likewise, the density varies from scarce density to densely packed hair strands. This hair type is drier when compared to other black hair types, and it breaks easily. It experiences shrinkage of up to 70% of its actual length, and this makes it to appear shorter than it really is.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/54b43d1ab2e45293.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ best messy hair captions for Instagram on a bad hair day</span></p></a><p class=align-left>If your hair type is 4B, you need to go for the protective hairstyles such as twists, buns, and braids to protect your hair from damage.

It does not have a defined curl pattern. The hair strands do not clamp easily. You need to apply some sort of styling technique to clamp your hair. The hair looks a lot shorter than it really is when it is not stretched out because it shrinks by up to 75%.</p><p class=align-left>Its texture ranges from soft, fine to coarse and densely packed strands.
