Aside from the fact that she could possibly be the first ever female president, she is also one of the first major candidates to embrace Gen Z and internet culture — in a way that resonates more than Hillary Clinton's "Pokémon GO to the polls."</p><p>Her entire run so far has been surrounded my memes, from her <a href=#>Brat-ification</a> courtesy of Charli XCX and her fanbase to the plethora of songs and TikToks that have been made out of her famous <a href=#>coconut tree quote</a>. It has been an effective way to reframe the Republican narrative surrounding her, and some even think that her memes may give her the boost she needs to win the presidency.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: tiktok/@kamalahq</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Kamala Harris's memes are making her more popular with young voters.</h2><p>If you're active at all on TikTok, then you've probably come across at least one Kamala Harris meme — potentially even posted by the official <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">KamalaHQ account</a>. The page has gone viral for their humorous and trendy approach to campaigning, and while not run by Harris herself, it is affiliated with the politician.</p><p>In fact, we have KamalaHQ to thank for one of Harris's most popular memes yet: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a slideshow</a> set to Chappel Roan's "Femininomenon" that sets up a dynamic between Harris and Trump, with Harris calling for a feminine revolution within the government. The post has over 55 million views and 7 million likes as of writing, with a plethora of comments in support of the presidential hopeful.</p><p>"You got the Gen Z vote with this one," one commenter wrote.</p><p>This relatable voice is even carried on by Harris herself within her rallies, with one <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">recent moment</a> going viral in which she addresses Trump's negative remarks toward her while <a href=#>refusing to debate her</a> on stage: "If you've got something to say, say it to my face."</p><p>Harris's presence in the Gen Z space has served to somewhat successfully reframe the Republican Party's narrative surrounding her, which is that she's "crazy," "unstable," and "annoying" — particularly relating to her laugh. Before her run for president, but especially so now, Trump has rallied his base by calling her one of his infamous nicknames: "Laughing Kamala." However, her supporters have turned that around in her favor, cherishing her propensity for laughter as something that makes her more human.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@noortril0gy href=#>@noortril0gy</a><p>Big Sister General <a title=kamalaharris href=#>#kamalaharris</a><a title=projectcoconut href=#>#projectcoconut</a><a title=kamalaharrisisajoke href=#>#kamalaharrisisajoke</a><a title=ae href=#>#ae</a><a title=viral href=#>#viral</a><a title=kamalaharrisedit href=#>#kamalaharrisedit</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - noor" href=#>♬ original sound - noor</a></figure><p>Another viral meme of the candidate is a perfect example: Big Sister General. In the clip, Harris shares a humorous moment <a href=#>with her sister</a> Maya during an interview; Maya explains that she won't be calling her sister General Harris, but instead "big sister," to which Harris makes the famous quip and the two burst out laughing.</p><p>From "Project Coconut" to "<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hotties for Harris</a>," the memes make her seem cool, grounded, and even accessible to a generation that has felt disengaged from politics in the past. Whether this will bump up her numbers enough to secure her the presidency is yet to be seen, but many of her supporters feel hopeful.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoK6urcuaZKGZoqe2tHnMnqSeqw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
