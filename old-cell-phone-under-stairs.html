She explained in a caption of her viral <a href=#>TikTok</a> post: "What a blast from the past. This had to belong to the previous owners of our home, we have lived here 10 years."</p><p>She begins her clip by looking into the camera and stating, "Wait until you see what my 9-year-old just found wedged underneath our carpet ... let me show you what I mean." She flips the orientation around to reveal a side profile view of the staircase she's talking about.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@domeafavorstl href=#>@domeafavorstl</a><p>What a blast from the past.

An old LG slider phone. The clip cuts to the mom telling him that the device she's holding in her hand is "not an iPhone," much to the protestations of her young child who can be heard speaking off camera.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @domeafavorstl</span></figure><p>"Yes it is, it's an iPhone 15 from 1997," he says.</p><p>She replies, "It's from the 1900s probably, but um yeah, look at this LG, this is not anyone in our family's home, this is from the previous owner, we have only lived here 10 years, so um, who has a charging cord for this?"</p><p>One TikToker in the comments section was surprised that she didn't have a random box of different chargers to use to try and power up the phone: "You don‚Äôt have a random box of charging cords?" the person asked.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok | @domeafavorstl</span></figure><p>Someone else thought the kid's commentary on the phone was hilarious: "'It‚Äôs an iPhone 15 from 1997' omg I‚Äôm dying üò≠ü§£."</p><p>Another user on the app thought that the secret phone may certainly have some pictures on it that weren't meant to be seen: "The hidden phone! Oh no the pics that could be on it."</p><p>There were other people who recognized the device ‚Äî the LG branded styled phone came from a time when devices were branded with the mobile carrier's logo and usually given different names. The LG Shine actually featured Lauren Conrad of Laguna Beach fame in a commercial rocking the device.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><p>The TikToker decided to go into what looks like her attic and cracked open an old plastic bin that was filled with various old electronics, including an old iHome iPod/iPhone docking station music speaker player.</p><p>She only had a few different charging cables at her disposal, however, and toward the end of the video, before it cuts out, she seemed to indicate that she was unsure if there was even a working battery inside of the device.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@domeafavorstl href=#>@domeafavorstl</a><p>Replying to @Chelsea part 2: i did not find a chsrging cord so to the dollar store i go! <a title=1900s href=#>#1900s</a> <a title=vintage href=#>#vintage</a> <a title=funny href=#>#funny</a> <a title=burnerphone href=#>#burnerphone</a> <a title=lgchocolate href=#>#lgchocolate</a> <a title=oldphone href=#>#oldphone</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - DoMeAFavorSTL" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - DoMeAFavorSTL</a></figure><p>In a third video she confirmed that the phone, indeed, doesn't have a battery inside of it, and she asked folks online if they wanted to send her a battery and charging cable to see if she could pop it in and fire it up.</p><p>It looks like chargers and data cables for the device are still for sale online ‚Äî the battery retails for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$4.95 on eBay here</a>, and you can get the charger for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">even cheaper at just $3.99</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@domeafavorstl href=#>@domeafavorstl</a><p>Replying to @keith Part 3: sorey to let yall down‚Ä¶ If someone wants to send me a charger snd battery we can get to investing! <a title=lgphone href=#>#LGphone</a> <a title=waterfallstairs href=#>#waterfallstairs</a> <a title=thankstiktok href=#>#thankstiktok</a> <a title=vintage href=#>#vintage</a></p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - DoMeAFavorSTL" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - DoMeAFavorSTL</a></figure><p>As of this writing, she hasn't posted any other updates as to what's in the phone, but what do you reckon is lurking within the old LG flip phone, and why was it hidden inside the carpet on her stairs?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpLmlecKeo6VloJ28r7GMrqWdnaJiwLWtyKuq</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
