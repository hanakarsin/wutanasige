Amanza Smith, for example, is constantly stirring the pot, while <a href=#>Chrishell Stause</a> is in the throws of a recent divorce from This is Us actor, Justin Hartley.</p><p>Although it seems as though Chrishell's divorce has been seriously painful for the successful realtor, fans (ourselves included!) are secretly hoping that <a href=#>Justin Hartley</a> will make some sort of appearance on Selling Sunset. We think it's rather unlikely he ever will, based on their seemingly negative rapport, but stay tuned for what we know on the matter.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Does Justin Hartley make an appearance on either season of 'Selling Sunset'?</h2><p>Selling Sunset, Season 1, premiered on March 22, 2019, about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">eight months before Chrishell and Justin's November 2019 divorce</a>, according to Heart. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Justin didn't appear in Season 1</a>, per IMDB, most likely because he was busy with work. Behind the scenes, Justin and Chrishell's marriage was also presumably failing.</p><p>Chrishell's Season 2 drama <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">predominantly focuses on her divorce,</a> so needless to say, Justin does not make any sort of appearance on Season 2 of the show, according to CheatSheet. And unfortunately, unless Justin and Chrishell reconcile, we don't think he'll come on for Season 3. At the end of Season 2, viewers see Chrishell mulling over her failed relationship.</p><p>“I’m just kind of in shock with it all... I love him so much. This was my best friend. Who do I talk to now?" she tells fellow realtor, Mary Fitzgerald, heartbroken before the Season 2 finale.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: YouTube</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Will Chrishell continue to co-parent Justin's daughter? Is she cut out of her life entirely?</h2><p>During Chrishell and Justin's two-year marriage, the realtor had been <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a stepmother to the actor's 15-year-old daughter, Isabella</a>, whom he parented with his previous ex-wife, Lindsay Hartley, according to ScreenRant. The 15-year-old high school student apparently had a fantastic relationship with Chrishell, and despite the divorce, they will hopefully maintain some sort of relationship moving forward. Right now, however, it seems as though Justin and Chrishell need as much space as possible.&nbsp;</p><p>Justin and Chrishell reportedly had planned to parent a child of their own together, prior to filing for divorce, but their relationship ended before Chrishell could get pregnant. It's most likely for the best they didn't try to mend their relationship by getting pregnant, but hopefully, if Chrishell wants to have a child of her own, she will be able to do so in the future with someone else.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>Chrishell and Justin's divorce, which was apparently filed for "irreconcilable differences," seems seriously messy, and it goes without saying we don't think the former Smallville star will ever come on the popular real estate reality series.&nbsp;</p><p>However, we are definitely hoping that Chrishell will find new love in the City of Angels, because the highly successful realtor deserves all of the happiness in the world.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsButtSsq6KmXZ2us8DLnrBmp55iwKa4y6KloGWjqru0sdM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
