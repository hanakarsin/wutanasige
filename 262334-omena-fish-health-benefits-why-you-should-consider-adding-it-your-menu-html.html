The benefits of omena during pregnancy have been found to curb some of these cravings for women who were able to eat omena fish when pregnant consistently. Does omena contain omega 3? This is one question that has come across when people search for the benefits of omena. It has been disappointing before when people find out that what they were promised turned out to be different. Here are the real benefits of omena.</p><h3>Rich in healthy ions</h3><p class=align-left>According to health experts, Omena or small dried fish have been proven to possess a higher protein content compared to similar amounts of goat, beef or even chicken meat. They are also a robust and excellent source of calcium which is found in the bones. The fact that omen is consumed whole means that people get all the calcium in the fish.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/9274f79b3e8b94e0.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Kenyans Express Mixed Reactions Over Mbeere Men Who Share Household Duties With Wives</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/adc81cb99cc3d930.jpeg><p class=align-left>Nutritionists indicate that omena can supply up to 170% of the daily intake requirement of calcium for the human body. This coupled with phosphorous is instrumental in the development of teeth and strong bones. This is why it is best recommended for growing children who are still developing as well as pregnant women who have babies forming in their wombs.</p><h3>Rich in vitamins</h3><p class=align-left>Omena is also rich in vitamin D which is great for the absorption of phosphorous and calcium. Recent research has revealed that the lack of vitamin D could be associated with some form of diabetes and cancers. Taking omena regularly could very well save you from some chronic diseases and guarantee you a healthy and long life.</p><p class=align-left>Furthermore, omena has been proven to a great source of some nutrient such as niacin and folate as well as B12. All these vitamins are part of the vitamin B group and a major requirement in the energy forming process. They are useful in cell energy formation and should form a great part of the eating plan. For this reason, a person taking omena every day has a better chance of being healthier than another person taking fancy foods that are devoid of useful nutrients. Also, when served with vegetable and lemon juice, there is a better chance that your body will have an enhanced iron absorption capability.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/0a721d60b5080cdd.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=29><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>50+ famous Ethiopian proverbs about love, life, and education</span></p></a><h2>Calories in omena fish – what are the dos and don’ts</h2><p class=align-left>This may be a concern for people who are watching their weight. However omena is rich in nutrients yet it has no baggage of unnecessary calories. Advisably, when preparing omena, soak them in some water for a few minutes then rinse them off and fry. This will reduce the amount of sodium that you will be consuming. You can cook your omena as you prefer but experts advise that you eat it whole for better absorption of vitamin A.</p><p class=align-left>With the benefits of omena having been elaborated above, the decision to eat it regularly rests with you. If you want to boost your health life, then you should consider including it in your diet.</p><p>Source: TUKO.co.ke</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tcHKqGWcp16gsnB%2BlWtqbGxdpLqmusBmnaKrmGK1pq3LrZ9mmpWjsqe106xksKCpYsawwYysn6itnJl6pLvNrKCdnaJirqWwyKeeZqGkYsawwdFmpJ6mpWO1tbnL</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
