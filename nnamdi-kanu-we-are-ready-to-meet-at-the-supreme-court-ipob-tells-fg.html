In the end, they set fire to those Trucks loaded with consumable goods.</p><p>“It’s not enough that the government sabotaged the importation of goods through seaports into Biafraland, they have resorted to attacking trucks hauling goods into the Eastern Region or Biafra Land so as to create artificial scarcity that will cause a hike in prices of those goods.</p><p>“This is another agenda of the government using food and other goods blockade as a weapon of war as they did against Biafrans during the 1967-1970 genocidal war.</p><p>“Security agents attacked trucks coming from Amorka in Ihiala LGA of Anambra state at the border community between Anambra and Imo State. We were reliably informed that Nigerian soldiers forced some of the truck drivers to block the roads and claimed that it was ESN Operatives and IPOB members that forced them to do so.</p><p>“The Army and other agencies forced the truck drivers to block roads in disguise of protesting that Mazi Nnamdi Kanu should be released without delay by the Federal Government of Nigeria.</p><p>“Enugu – Aba – Igweocha Expresses ways were also blocked with 6 trucks. Enugu – Onitsha expressway near the toll gate was blocked by 7 trucks. Obolo Afor, Enugu state also blocked by some truck drivers.</p><p>“IPOB never forced truck drivers to block roads in protest for Mazi Nnamdi Kanu’s release. IPOB know how to handle issues without Nigeria Security Agents directing us on what to do. This arrangement to use truck drivers to block routes leading to the East is a secret agenda of security agents to create unrest and destroy our people’s lives and properties.</p><p>“We have numerous Seaports where our businessmen and women can ship their goods to land and it will be easy for them to collect, but the Nigeria Government out of wickedness shut down all seaports in Biafraland.</p><p>“IPOB always have our people in mind and will never allow any activity that will jeopardize the interest and wellbeing of our people.</p><p>“The Court of Appeal verdict of 13th of October, 2022 must be obeyed. However, we are ready to meet the Lawless Nigeria Government in the Supreme Court on Monday, October 24, 2022.</p><p>“There is no amount of threat or intimidation that can make IPOB retreat from the Biafra Restoration project,” Powerful submitted.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5FsZqemkaKxqnnKmqWuZaeaeqK%2BxGapnpmUrnq1u4ymnJ6sXZbBbsDHnmSsraCnsq6xjJymrqqkYraxu8Fmq56knKh6p7OO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
