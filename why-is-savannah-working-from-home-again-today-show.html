But back in April 2020, with kids at home and the threat of a virus outside of the safety of her home, she had to make the decision to put her family first at all costs. Even if it meant tons of technical difficulties while reporting the news from her basement.</p><p>But does Savannah still work from home now?</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Why is Savannah working from home again on 'Today'?</h2><p>As People magazine notes, Savannah still <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">occasionally</a> works from her home studio.</p><p>Recently, Savanna gave fans a look at her setup and how her kids are involved in it all.</p><p>In a candid <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> post shared with her 1 million followers on August 19, 2021, Savannah gave fans a behind-the-scenes look at her home studio setup.

She posted on Instagram that she had stayed home at the time on the advice of NBC officials and medical staff.</p><p>Savannah felt healthy otherwise, but for the sake of her co-hosts, she took the time to stay home and avoid potentially spreading anything to them if she was in the studio.

"My family is upstate, and so I‚Äôm sticking close to the family and coming to the city less and less. So I‚Äôm trying to work from home.
