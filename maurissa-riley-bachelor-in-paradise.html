I know the video is all fun and games, but I do think something needs to be clarified. I don't need to explain what I said, because I said it with conviction..." she began. "However, there are other women that may not be as nonchalant or as indifferent as I am, to handle the kind of criticism that I've been receiving, and it's not OK.To my next point, it's OK FOR WOMEN TO LIKE SEX!"</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Maurissa Gunn (@maurissagunn)</a></p></figure><p>"Sex is a two person act, so there shouldn't be a double standard regarding which gender can openly like it, and which gender should be timid about their enjoyment. What's even harder to believe is that the majority of the negativity and hate is coming from women," she added. "It's already hard enough being a woman in today’s society, so we as women should do everything to lift each other up rather than bring each other down. I hope this message is received with love and kindness."</p><p>Maurissa and Riley's journey will continue on Bachelor in Paradise.
