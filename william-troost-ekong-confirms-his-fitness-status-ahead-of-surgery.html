He, however, played throughout the game as the hosts defeated Nigeria 2-1 to win the title.</p><p>Before then, Troost-Ekong suffered a hamstring injury in the 2023 AFCON group stage, which forced him to miss Nigeria’s 1-0 win over Guinea-Bissau in the last game of the group stage.</p><p>After missing the game, he played all the remaining games before he sustained his current injury in the tournament’s final.</p><p>The said injury will force him to stay out of football for three to six months <a href=# rel=noopener>as he is set to undergo surgery this week.</a></p><p>“As many know, I got injured during AFCON. Disappointingly, this injury has turned out to be more serious than first thought. I have always given everything and pushed myself. Every player has played with pain at some point in their career to fight for a club or country. It’s part of the game,” Troost-Ekong said on Tuesday.</p><p>“I managed to continue in the knockout stages, and I was willing to continue to do the same now to help PAOK push for the prizes in the league and Europe too. But after more assessments and consultations it was the best decision long-term to undergo surgery now. My full focus is on getting back better than ever before.”</p><p>Due to the lengthy period William Troost-Ekong will stay sidelined from an injury he sustained in an international competition, PAOK are entitled to get compensation from the world football governing body, FIFA, if they choose to write FIFA to that effect.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ze5FxZrChnKG2ormMramop6Opeqa3zqeeZpufo7OqvsysZKGho2KzqsDNnqqsZaOprrXB0maYoZ2RmXqwsoysrKuflafGcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
