it is a good thing that the country is designing its currency, because how can you have an effective monetary policy when you don’t have control over 85 percent of your currencies.</p><p>“Out there, people are holding it, people are using it to speculate on foreign currencies, and so coming out with this policy ,the government is trying to contend with it.”</p><p>“I am sure that those people that are holding back this money whether legitimately or illegitimately, we will be able to monitor and the right cause of the law will take its course,” Bawa added.</p><p>Speaking about the commission’s fight against cybercrime, the EFCC chairman explained that the support of Nigerian youth is needed in the fight against cybercrime, hence he used the medium to appeal for their assistance.</p><p>He furthered that the activities of those criminals have ruined the image of Nigeria in the global arena, and it calls for an agent need to curb the criminal activities in the country.</p><p>He pointed out that between January and now, the agency had convicted 2,847 cybercrime perpetrators, the highest record so far.</p><p>“These are Nigerians from the youthful constituency, they should join me in fighting the scourge of Cybercrime.</p><p>“It is part of our mandate to fight cybercrime, to fight advance fee fraud,and we are working in conformity with the law.</p><p>“I am pleading with them not to stop doing such things at this time of transition of the country in terms of elections, in terms of government efforts to see that the economy is back on track,” he noted.</p><p>While appreciating the National Assembly’s support, he said ” I want to use this opportunity to thank the National Assembly for their support as EFCC Chairman, particularly the committee on anti-corruption.</p><p>“They have been with us 100 percent.&nbsp; You remember recently they have worked with us to pass landmark Acts and legislations and the President has assented to it.</p><p>“So, we are working with them towards ensuring that this country is free of economic and financial crimes,” Bawa remarked.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5FwZmtoYmh6prLCnGStp12lrrPAzZ6pZqGemrBurcaaoKerpGLDsMDEZpmusZmjtHA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy;
