We were at the station this morning and paid a condolence visit to the family.”</p><p>Effiong added that the man in the picture seen holding his head is the husband of the killed lawyer.</p><p>“The grieving man that is holding his head with his two hands in the photo is the husband of the deceased lawyer. He could barely utter a word while we were in his house,” he said.</p><h2>Update</h2><p>In a fresh update on the incident, Effiong claimed that the police officer who shot Bolanle is now identified as ASP Drambi Vandi and not ASP Ayuba as earlier reported.</p><p>The popular lawyer, however, called on the police authorities to come out clean on the identity of the killer policeman.</p><p>“UPDATE: I’m now hearing that the officer’s name is “ASP Drambi Vandi.” We were earlier told that his name is ASP Ayuba. The police should come out clean on the identity of this killer policeman. We understand he’ll be due for retirement soon. He must not be shielded,” Inibehe Effiong wrote on Twitter.</p><h2>We Are Investigating</h2><p>The Lagos State Police Command has appealed for calm regarding the unfortunate killing of the female lawyer by one of its operatives.</p><p>The PRO of the command, <strong>Benjamin Hundeyin</strong> while reacting to the incident in a statement on Monday said justice would take its course as the erring officer and his team have been arrested already.</p><p>He conveyed the condolence message of the State Police Commissioner, <strong>Abiodun Alabi</strong> to the family of the deceased as well.</p><p>He said; “The Commissioner of Police, Lagos State Command, CP Abiodun Alabi, fdc has expressed heartfelt condolences to the family, friends and colleagues of Barrister Bolanle Raheem who was shot dead by a police officer in Ajah on Sunday, December 25, 2022.</p><p>“On the instruction of the Commissioner of Police, the errant officer has since been taken into custody alongside his team members. The CP has equally directed that the case be transferred to the State Criminal Investigation Department, Yaba for in-depth investigation.</p><p>“This has become one too many, especially bearing in mind that a similar incident occurred at the same location less than three weeks ago. The condemnable incident is against the standard operating procedures (SOP) and rules of engagement of the Force, and to say the least is embarrassing.</p><p>“Beyond this incident, the Nigeria Police Force will carry out a reappraisal of its rules of engagement in a bid to put an end to such avoidable ugly incidents.</p><p>“The Lagos State Police Command hereby appeals to the good people and residents of Lagos State to remain calm as the Command is already in constant touch with the Nigerian Bar Association and other relevant stakeholders towards ensuring that justice totally prevails.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5ze5FvZqmgn6m8brXDnqWtoaSuerCyjKmmpaGTmnqwssWimp6qXay1sHnKoqOlnZRiuaKzzqxkpZmnrrKzec6nZJygop7AtbnArGSdmalisq6x0aCcrGc%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
