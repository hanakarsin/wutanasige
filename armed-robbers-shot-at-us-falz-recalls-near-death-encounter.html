Tragically, the driver lost his life instantly due to the gunfire. The artist expressed gratitude for surviving the ordeal and reflected on the gravity of the situation during that fateful journey.</p><p>He additionally disclosed that the assailants who targeted them were “turban-tying, AK47-wielding,” and it was during the peak days of Boko Haram in the country.</p><p>He shared this account during his appearance on the latest episode of “Untapped” with media personality Gbemi O.</p><p>His words: “It was after NYSC, and this was me working in my dad’s firm as a lawyer in 2013.</p><p>“Then we got a call to come to Abuja for a show. The payment was N1 million, and logistics will be taken care of. It was a wedding, so we took the trip.</p><p>“There was no flight from Abuja to Lagos. So we hired a car from Abuja to Benin. I led a solid prayer, which probably ended up saving us.</p><p>“It was broad daylight, and we started the trip around 2 p.m. We fell asleep during the trip.</p><p>“Then we just heard a loud bang. We woke up to see these turban-tying, AK47-wielding, dangerous-looking men in the middle of the expressway.</p><p>“The bang we heard was a gunshot they had shot at the car. They shot at our car again, and the bullet came flying in between everyone. Everything happened so fast.</p><p>“They shot at us again, and the bullet hit the driver in the eye. The driver died instantly. The car started moving. It was wild. I remember seeing the car heading for a ditch and just thinking, this is it.</p><p>“Then we passed out. I was the first to come around. I got out of the car and saw one of the men asking, ‘Where is the money?’ I told him there was no money. He goes to the car, looking for cash.</p><p>“We had left Abuja, but we hadn’t gotten to Lokoja. It was all forest. It was the peak of Boko Haram, and we were somewhere in the north.</p><p>“We started to hear sirens from far away. The police did not come near. At this point, they increased fire and started shooting. They later moved away from us and retreated.</p><p>“We tried to stop cars on the expressway, but not a single soul stopped. A police guy eventually came, and another guy said he was a doctor.”</p><p>Falz expressed that he harboured concerns that his parents might not have permitted him to pursue his music career further following the traumatic experience.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ye5FpZpqqnZqxbr7Om5meqqNiwKm702aYrWWlqHqnrcuzZKudk5a5rb%2BMp5yaql2ZsqLAx2acp5ufqru1sdFo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
