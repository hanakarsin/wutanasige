With eight people dead and three more still hospitalized following the Nov. 5, 2021, festival, there has been a lot of talk about what is going to be done in the wake of it all.</p><p>Aside from funeral costs, lawsuits, and the bevy of other legal issues that this tragedy has already brought about, one question remains amongst concertgoers: Will <a href=#>Travis Scott</a> issue refunds for Astroworld 2021 ticket holders and how can they be acquired? Here's what we know so far.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Will Travis Scott be issuing refunds for Astroworld?</h2><p>Festival runners have announced that they will be issuing full refunds for any and all attendees of the 2021 Astroworld festival. In a joint statement from Live Nation, Scoremore, and the Astroworld festival team, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">KHOU11</a>, they explained what they were doing to investigate the situation and touched on the available refunds for attendees.</p><p>"Throughout the weekend, we have been working to provide local authorities with everything they need from us in order to complete their investigation and get everyone the answers they are looking for," they said in their statement. "Our staff has met with local authorities to provide information, and we have also provided them with all footage from our CCTV cameras."</p><p>The statement concluded with the mention that "load out of site and equipment is currently paused to give investigators the time they requested to walk and document the grounds. Full refunds are being offered for all those who purchased tickets."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">How can you get a refund for your Astroworld tickets if you attended?</h2><p>Although the controlling entities behind the festival said that refunds would be made available to all ticket holders, they did not specify exactly when or how they would go about offering them.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What has been done already aside from offering refunds?</h2><p>Aside from mentioning full refunds, Travis and a few of the other entertainers involved with Astroworld 2021 have pledged to help those affected by the tragedy in more ways than one. Rapper Roddy Ricch announced that he will be giving his "net compensation" from the festival to the families of those who passed away that night.</p><p>Travis has released two statements since the event transpired. He offered his sincere apologies and pledged to cover all of the funeral costs for everyone who passed away at Astroworld. Per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">ET</a>, Travis has also partnered with BetterHelp, which offers therapy and mental health assistance, to provide services to anyone who went to the festival and now needs it.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=und dir=ltr><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ijXKslw7E2</a></p>â€” TRAVIS SCOTT (@trvisXX) <a href=#>November 6, 2021</a></figure><p>In a statement, BetterHelp said, "In order to support the mental health of those impacted by the events that took place at Astroworld, BetterHelp is providing one month of free therapy to all attendees. Once signed up, members will be matched to a therapist within 48 hours. The link to get started is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">betterhelp.com/cactusjackfoundation</a>."</p><p>According to a separate statement made to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNN</a>, Travis is still looking to do way more than he already is. "These are the first of many steps Travis plans on taking as a part of his personal vow to assist those affected throughout their grieving and recovery process," representatives told the publication. It is unclear what other steps the artist and his partners will be taking yet.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4edOoZKCdpGKutMDRqK6oqpyZerOxxa6lnas%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
