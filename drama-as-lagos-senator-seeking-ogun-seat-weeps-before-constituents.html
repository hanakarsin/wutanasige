This is an unprecedented feat signifying a new trajectory of collectivity and brotherhood in Ogun West Senatorial district.”</p><p>Senator Adeola while receiving the form said, “I thank God Almighty for a day like this, I am short of words. Today, I am more than happy and I am more than grateful to God for my people have taken this bold step and think that the best thing to do is to buy my nomination forms for the Senate of Ogun West . It is more than enough for me.”</p><p>“I vividly remember when I decided to return home , it was tough. I asked myself what I am about to do, is it the right thing or the wrong thing? Initially when I saw the heavy resistance that was given to me across the length and breadth of my land. I was afraid. They said I am not a Yewa man. All sorts of lies, all sorts of confusion everywhere.</p><p>“Even the then Governor sponsored my people against me , they told me that I am from Ekiti , that I am not from Yewa and they did that rigorously, campaigned with it, said all sorts of things about it. My people did not believe me I had to go to another Senatorial district, that is why you hear that Yayi is popular in other senatorial districts then because they believed in me that I was from Yewa, but today my people have accepted the fact that I am from Yewa . I am now more popular in Yewa, Ogun West than any other state.</p><p>“You have shown to me today that there is no cause to regret my decision to return back home. I must say this, I am overwhelmed.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH12e49uZp2qkaKubq3SZqOan5%2BoerSxzZqrqKpdqLKmt8innmanl6q7br%2FEmqtmr5WavbR5wZ6dqKqVYrCwutKtoK2tlaPBtHs%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
