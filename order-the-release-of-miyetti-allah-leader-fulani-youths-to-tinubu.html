By this illegal act, the Army is going outside its constitutional duty.”</p><p>Suleiman, however, appealed to the members of the association and Bello’s kinsmen to remain calm and law-abiding as they await the release of their leader.</p><p>The Fulani youth leader said the detention of Bodejo by the Nigerian Army without trial smacks of impunity of the highest order, warning that lawyers are warming up to the matter.</p><p>“If the Army has any evidence against Bello Bodejo, committing an offence known to the law, he should be arraigned before a competent court. Subjecting him to illegal detention is an infringement on his fundamental human rights as enshrined in the constitution.</p><p>“The Nigerian security apparatus, which is known for its professionalism, and respecter of the rule of law, should demonstrate such etiquettes known to it, by granting the President of the Miyetti Allah Kautal Hore, Abdullahi Bello Bodejo his constitutional rights as a law-abiding citizen of the Federal Republic of Nigeria and should be allowed to go home as his continuous detention is illegal and unconstitutional,” the statement added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ze5BsZqiqlJq%2FbsDHnmSrnZyarrSxjKidZqWZrrK1wMhmmKWkkZ16rbHAnZyrZZaquaK6yGawqK2kncBuwM5mq6KmpZfCcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
