Well, as much as possible.</p><p>The <a href=#>final Season 6 episodes</a> had several bombshells, including the unexpected departure of one controversial single, <a href=#>Valentina Rueda Velez</a>. What happened?</p><p>Valentina, who flaunts her affiliation with One Management—a modeling agency with hubs in N.Y., Los Angeles, Chicago, Spain, and the United Kingdom—has certainly caught everyone’s eye. Naturally, fans are eager for answers about her sudden exit. Here’s everything we know.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Netflix</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Why did Valentina leave 'Too Hot to Handle'?</h2><p>Valentina left Too Hot to Handle before the season finale, but not because she wasn't convinced she wouldn't find a hottie to become her next, as she calls it, "plaything." She reportedly chose to leave due to personal family reasons. Valentina didn't disclose any details on the show.</p><p>Valentina was introduced to Too Hot to Handle fans during Season 6, Episode 4. The 23-year-old Colombian model came to the retreat looking for a man who could match her fiery personality. But when she entered the competition, she got on her roommates' bad side by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">throwing shade</a> at fellow competitors <a href=#>Bri</a> and <a href=#>Lucy</a> when they criticized her choice to kiss Bri's eventual man, <a href=#>Demari</a>, causing the group to lose $600 from the <a href=#>prize fund</a>.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by VALENTINA (@valentinarueda.v)</a></p></figure><p>Since exiting Too Hot to Handle, Valentina has posted videos and bikini photos on her Instagram account. On Aug. 1, 2024, the day before the final Season 6 episodes dropped, she shared a video of her dancing to Cardi B's song "Tomorrow 2" and tagged THTH in her post. And despite getting tons of questions asking her why she left the show, she's keeping fans guessing until she's ready.</p><p>While many fans weren't incredibly sad to see the bombshell go, some expected Netflix to acknowledge Valentina's absence, though the time never came. Instead, the competition continued, and in the season finale, <a href=#>Bri and Demari were crowned the winners</a> of the $100,000, with <a href=#>Gianna</a> winning the individual title and a cash prize of $25,000.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by VALENTINA (@valentinarueda.v)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Some fans think Valentina from 'Too Hot Too Handle' should try out 'Love Is Blind' instead.</h2><p>Although things didn’t work out for Valentina on Too Hot to Handle—whether for personal reasons or otherwise—there are plenty of other reality TV dating competition shows she might consider if she’s still interested in that scene. On her Instagram stories, she reposted a fan’s suggestion that she appear on <a href=#>Love Is Blind</a>, but wasn’t too keen on the idea, citing her lack of “talking skills.” “Imagine if all I had to do was talk,” she wrote, followed by some crying emojis.</p><p style=text-align:start>Although she shot down the idea of Love Is Blind, Valentina revealed to fans that she still lives in Colombia but vacations in Los Angeles.</p><p style=text-align:start>While we might not see her on another reality TV show, she seems to be thriving and enjoying life following her abrupt departure.</p><p style=text-align:start>Stream Love Is Blind on Netflix now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfrLW6ecOim2aukaGyr8DIp5hmpJWWw6Z506imZqCfqXq1u4yhmKecnJo%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
