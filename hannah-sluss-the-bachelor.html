Reality Steve leaked that she won Peter’s <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">first impression rose</a> — but don’t forget that no one who’s won a first-impression rose <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">has ever won the Bachelor</a>, maybe taking her out of the running now.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">So, who is first impression rose winner Hannah Sluss?</h2><p>It's almost impossible to get the internet-dirt on Hannah since most of her social media accounts are currently private (you can forget ogling at her Instagram feed before the season premiere).&nbsp;</p><p>But not to worry, here’s everything we’ve learned so far about Peter’s first pick:</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">She’s a model and actress.</h2><p>According to her <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Facebook</u></a> (which is her only public social media account), she’s signed to Wilhelmina Models — and she's been keeping busy. Along with being featured in Chris Lane's —&nbsp;who is coincidentally engaged to former Bachelor alum Lauren Bushnell — "I Don't Know About You" music video, some of her best works include a feature on Downy detergent and a Sonic drive-thru poster.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-fyFmx rJYJh"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Hannah's got the cutest dog.&nbsp;</h2><p>His name is Biscuit, and I’m already in love with him.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Facebook</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">She’s tight with Bachelor alum Hannah G.&nbsp;</h2><p>It looks like Hannah S. goes way back with former Bachelor contestant Hannah Godwin. The duo posted a photo on Instagram together last summer, and captioned the photo, "The Hannahs (lip syncing isn’t our forte)."&nbsp;</p><p>We hope Hannah G. gave Hannah S. some tips for making it to the end —&nbsp;or at least Bachelor in Paradise.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Hannah's a former pageant girl.&nbsp;</h2><p>Hannah has competed in the Miss Tennesee pageant more than once, but she's only one of the many contestants who's a former pageant queen.&nbsp;</p><p>If you want to know how she did though, just look at this video of her answering one of the judge's questions.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>I’m very well aware that pageant competitions can be nerve wracking and anyone can freeze up when asked a question. Well one of Peters women, Hannah Sluss, almost had her own “Such as South Africa, and the Iraq, everywhere, like, such as...” moment a few years ago... <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/7NQ5BIpQ72</a></p>— RealitySteve (@RealitySteve) <a href=#>September 19, 2019</a></figure><p>We're not judging — pageants can have a lot of pressure. But we don't think she won any points with this non-answer.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">There’s already some beef between her and some other contestants...&nbsp;</h2><p>Another spoiler from Reality Steve: after winning a fashion-show style group date (and scoring a bunch of Revolve clothing from the win), Kelsey, contestant and former pageant-winner, seemed upset at Hannah’s victory. According to Reality Steve, Kelsey's "not a fan" of Hannah.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>(SPOILER): When it was all over and Hannah had won, Kelsey was called over by production to the back. Thinking it may seem like since Kelsey was a former pageant winner, she has an issue with Hannah winning. Was told told Kelsey was not a fan of Hannah. A lot of eye rolling.</p>— RealitySteve (@RealitySteve) <a href=#>September 27, 2019</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">She was spotted wearing a wedding dress in a competition.</h2><p>Yes, you read that right. During the fashion-show style group date, Hannah donned a wedding gown as her day dress. We're not saying that she's jumping to conclusions, but she might be jumping to conclusions.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>(SPOILER): 3 judges were Carson Kressly (not Bobby Berk), Janice Dickinson, and someone who worked for Revolve. It was a Revolve fashion show. They did day and night looks. Hannah came out in a wedding dress for day dress. Production told audience to stand and cheer for her.</p>— RealitySteve (@RealitySteve) <a href=#>September 27, 2019</a></figure><p>This also could be why Kelsey had some beef with Hannah's performance during their group date. Yikes.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">So, what are Hannah's chances of winning? Warning: Spoilers ahead.&nbsp;</h2><p>Well, it's hard to tell right now, since filming for the season just started. But Hannah currently is not one of the front-runners to be a finalist. It's rumored that Sarah Coffin, also from Knoxville, TN, will likely either win or go on to be the next Bachelorette.&nbsp;</p><p>Season 24 of The Bachelor premieres January 2020 on ABC&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfna6vusChZKykpajAbsDHnmSbmZOdsq270Q%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
