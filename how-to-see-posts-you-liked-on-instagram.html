Of course, if you're wanting to check if you've already liked a specific post, you can just go to that post to see if it already has been liked.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/media.distractify.com/brand-img/SIx1UUnDs/0x0/instagram-app-1645658709634.jpg><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>To see your recently liked posts, go to your profile tab (the one at the bottom right of Instagram's home screen). Then, tap the three lines in the top right corner; on the following screen, select "Your activity," which is marked by a small clock icon.</p><p>From here, you can select "Interactions" (the two arrows pointing in opposite directions), and then "Likes."</p><p>This then shows you the 300 most recent photos you've liked on the site. You can tap on any of the images shown and it will automatically take you to that post.</p><p>You can also mass unlike posts from this page. Tap the "Select" button in the upper right corner, then tap on the posts you want to unlike. At the bottom, it'll say "Unlike" with the number of photos you've selected in parenthesis. Tap this when you've selected all of the photos you want to unlike.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><p lang=en dir=ltr>instagram getting rid of the "posts you've liked" feature is my villain origin story... i don't want that "manage likes" stuff i want to see my likes in the order that i liked, not when the posts were posted</p>— ً (@flickerlix) <a href=#>February 16, 2022</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">How to look at other Instagram users' liked posts.</h2><p>It's been years since Instagram removed the feature that allowed you to see who was liking what photo under the "Following" tab, but there are still ways to see who's liking what photo on the app (it's just a much less easy process).</p><p>There are plenty of online services that will let you see the recent activity of any public account, but if you're not interested in signing up for yet another website (we don't blame you), then there are some ways to do some sleuthing on your own.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>If there's one specific person's photos you want to see if your Instagram user of choice is liking, then all you have to do is go to their profile and scroll through the images, looking for this person's username in the likes.
