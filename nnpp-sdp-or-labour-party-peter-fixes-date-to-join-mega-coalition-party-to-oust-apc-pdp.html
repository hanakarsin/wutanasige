Unfortunately,&nbsp; recent developments within our party make it practically impossible to continue participating and making such constructive contributions.</p><p>“Our national challenges are deep-seated and require that we each make profound sacrifices towards reducing our country. My commitments to rescuing Nigeria remains firm, even if the route differs.”</p><p><strong>Naija News</strong> gathered that the financial expert is now exploring different political parties and his chances of clinching their presidential ticket.</p><p>Obi, who enjoys massive support from the youths, is reportedly in talks with Labour Party, Social Democratic Party (SDP) and the Senator Rabiu Musa Kwankwaso-led New Nigeria Peoples Party (NNPP).</p><p>“We are in talks with Labour Party, SDP and a few others. We will announce our new party in the next 24 hours. It will be a party that is also youth-friendly since we have discovered that the youths form the bulk of our supporters,” said an associate of the former governor told The PUNCH.</p><p>It was also learnt that Peter Obi is looking to join a coalition that could defeat the PDP and the <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>All Progressives Congress (APC)</a></strong> in next year’s election.</p><p>“There is a plan for some major parties to form a mega party although this is coming quite late. Discussions are still ongoing but Obi is expected to be the presidential candidate. Kwankwaso is also part of the discussions. Everything will be clear by Thursday,” said a chieftain of the PDP.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH12e5FvZqemoKV6tLDPZqarZZyWr7DB0WanmqqkrnqxsdOeqWaema2ytHnDmqueZaSkequ7yKdkpp2Xlnqku8CloK2hn6N6sa3RrbBmrJ9ivLa%2F02aYqZtdpbGxew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
