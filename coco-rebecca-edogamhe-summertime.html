"Summer and I are similar. From a certain aspect, I had no difficulties â€” but then it was also difficult to deal with some of the personal traits we have in common."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: netflix</span></figure><p>"We are both very ordinary girls," she continues, in a statement Distractify would dispute. After all, Coco appears to be anything but ordinary. "She is perhaps more introspective than I am," the actress reveals of her character.</p><p>The Netflix series â€” which is based on a novel turned 2004 movie, Tre metri sopra il cielo (Three Steps Over Heaven) â€” revolves around the summer love between Coco's character, aptly named Summer (an unusual name in Italian, other characters are ready to note), and Ale, a former motorcycle champion.</p><p>For both of them, the summer will bring an unforgettable love story and chapter in their lives that will change them irreparably from who they were before they met on the Adriatic Coast.
