I’m responsible for that.</p><p>“We’re out of the Cup, we wanted to play a very different game and compete.</p><p>“The game took a direction because of the first goal but we have to see much more from the team and earn the right to win.</p><p>“I’m disappointed with myself. We wanted to play differently and we weren’t able to do that. Every time we lose the pain is there.</p><p>“We have to use this pain and this defeat to prepare the best way for Newcastle [in the Premier League] on Saturday.”</p><p>The win over Arsenal in the Carabao Cup means West Ham have advanced to the quarterfinals of the competition for the third successive season and will travel to face Liverpool on December 19.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpjZH5ye49rZqahm5q5bq3RrZytmV2XuaK5xKxkoaGdqLKtsoyana2domKus7%2FEp5ilZZaaua1506hksJ2jqXqprcxo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
