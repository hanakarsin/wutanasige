His first, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Trejo’s Tacos</a>, is located in L.A.’s Miracle Mile, with off-shoots in Hollywood, Santa Monica, and the L.A. Farmers' Market. He’s since branched out with locations in Chicago and Miami, and even has his own line of hot sauce.</p><p>Danny has become such a big name in the taco business that even his vegan cauliflower tacos made the L.A. Times’ list of their <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">10 favorite recipes of 2017</a>. (You can make the “deeply addictive” tacos for yourself with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">his recipe here</a>.)</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: FOX</span></figure><p>Now, Danny is bringing his taco knowledge to the latest challenge on Hell’s Kitchen.</p><p>In the Jan. 5 episode, titled “Everyone's Taco'ing About It,” the final nine chefs are put to the test creating elevated tacos with various proteins — chicken, beef, pork, fish, and shrimp.</p><p>In an exclusive clip shared with Distractify, <a href=#>Gordon Ramsay</a> is seen introducing the chefs to the challenge. “We all know that great chefs today are taking comfort foods and elevating [them] into something really special,” he says.</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>Of course, Danny is there to inspire the chefs to take the humble taco and turn it into something unexpected and creative. As Danny <a href=#>previously told Distractify</a>, it's not really about what's put into a taco that makes it tasty. "You can put anything in a taco ... they're versatile," he told us. So, what does make for a good taco? "Just love," he revealed.</p><p>Which Hell's Kitchen contestant will put in enough love to win over the taco connoisseur? You’ll just have to tune in to find out when Danny appears on the Jan. 5 episode on Fox.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: FOX</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Danny Trejo has appeared on 'Hell's Kitchen' and other food shows before.</h2><p>If you’re a fan of cooking competitions or just culinary shows in general, you’ve likely seen Danny Trejo pop up before.</p><p>He previously appeared on Hell’s Kitchen as a guest diner at the final dinner service in Season 16. He’s also been featured on Travel Channel’s Food Paradise, Anthony Bourdain: Parts Unknown, and served as a guest judge on Season 17 of <a href=#>Top Chef</a>.</p><p>Hell’s Kitchen: Battle of the Ages is produced by ITV America’s ITV Entertainment in association with A. Smith & Co.
