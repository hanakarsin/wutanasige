Arun & Natalia and Dusty & Ryan left in the second slot in "Rock Bottom."</p><p>In the Road Block, the teams were tasked with searching through five thousand rocks at the Theatro Dasous to each find one of the four stones with gold coins underneath. Raquel, Dusty, Arun, and Kim elected to complete the challenge, and the arduous nature of the Road Block meant that all four were at the outdoor theater at one time.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: CBS</span></figure><p>The task tested the everyone's patience, and once Raquel, Kim, and Arun found their lucky rocks (in that order), Dusty began to get in his head.</p><p>After nearly three hours of looking, Dusty was able to find the final gold coin. Though Dusty and Ryan were able to finish out the "Break 'Em" Detour rather quickly, the two were still the last team to arrive at the Pit Stop.</p><p>Thankfully for the B&B owner and the Prison Counts podcast host, host Phil Keoghan confirmed that the leg was a non-elimination one.</p><p>Leading into the finale, friends Dusty & Ryan, spouses Kim & Penn, pals Cayla & Raquel, and father/daughter duo Arun & Natalia are the four remaining teams.
