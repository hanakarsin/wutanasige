Maybe it was the moment of the game [but] I was feeling good.</p><p>“I would also have been happy for him to take it but I’m sure he’s going to score many more goals for us.”</p><p>In his response, Victor Osimhen who has scored just a goal in his two appearances in the 2023 AFCON said it doesn’t matter who scores as far as the team wins.</p><p>“For me, I don’t mind. I can take it and if I score or I miss, it is part of the game,” the Napoli striker said.</p><p>“But of course he took it and he scored it, and it shows great leadership. The team winning is the most important thing.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye5ByZrChnKG2ormMramop6Opeqa3zqeeZqqVq7KiuNJmrqGxXZ2ybsDOqKJmppmcsrO1wKxkqZ2elrm1xYyipayslZaxbrvFZqasoZ2dsq97</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
