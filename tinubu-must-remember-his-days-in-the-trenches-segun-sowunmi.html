He should remember his days in the trenches. He should look at his people firmly in the eyes and say I am not here to add to the burdens of Nigerians.</p><p>“If people in the South-West could be shouting they are hungry, you can imagine what is happening in far-flung parts of the country where commerce and industry are not so localized.”</p><p>Speaking further, Sowunmi condemned Tinubu’s tax system.</p><p>“I can see what the President is trying to do with taxation, he is trying to have a unitary tax system and remove multiple taxation with the hope that it will stimulate growth but I am surprised that President Tinubu thinks that the solution to this is devaluation of currency.</p><p>“You don’t have to imagine that every policy failure of the government must be burdened on the people or what were you thinking was going to happen to the people when the cost of the exchange rate was going to be such that even a loaf of bread is no longer what it used to be when a bag of rice is N60,000.</p><p>“What do they want people to eat? So, I am telling President Tinubu that his neo-libra policies are totally off-tangent, only making life so difficult and forcing many more people into poverty. There’s this need to have conversations around all of these and look critically into them,” he added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH1ye5ByZq2hnqqvtnnMrqqtZaKauqa5wZ6pZqCZqHqlrdisZKKmXam1pnnTq5ynm5iawG6%2FxKCsp2WjpMS2usyiZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
