Tonight's episode will center in part on the story of Wyley Simpson, 28, and Stephan Gaeth, 27, a gay male couple who became naturally pregnant with their biological child.</p><p>"I am a man and I am actually pregnant," says Wyley in a teaser for Friday's show. The couple, who met on Grindr, fell in love at first sight. In the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a>, Stephan gushes about how Wyley's bio said "country boy, loves animals, vegan," and Wyley, in turn, reveals what made him fall in love with Stephan on their first date: "I loved how he dressed, I loved how he acted, I loved his demeanor, his personality."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: WE</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">So, how did Wyley get pregnant?</h2><p>"This pregnancy was definitely not planned, absolutely not," says Wyley in Extreme Love's trailer. After many years of feeling "uncomfortable" in his "female-born body," Wyley began his transition in 2012. "I identify as a transgender male," he tells the camera. "I could finally be my true self of who I wanted to be and who I wanted to become as a man."</p><p>"Everybody that I've dated in the past, they haven't accepted me for who I was," Wyley reveals. But with Stephan, things were different from the get-go: "Stephan knew right off the bat that I was a transgender male."&nbsp;</p><p>And it was during his transition that Wyley became pregnant. Although he had top surgery in 2013, he hasn't yet gotten operated down there. "It was a question," Stephan opens up. "Can you get pregnant?"&nbsp;</p><p>But the couple discussed Wyley's hormonal treatment and went over what he had been told by his doctors — essentially, that he couldn't get pregnant on testosterone. That's what the couple "believed to be truth," Stephan shares.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: WE</span></figure><p>One day, however, Wyley woke up nauseous and realized something was off with his body. "I started having morning sickness and found out I was pregnant at 11 weeks," he says. "After I saw that it popped positive, I was nervous, I was very emotional. I started crying, I didn't know what to do, I didn't know what to think, I didn't know what to say."&nbsp;</p><p>And although the couple briefly debated giving the child up for adoption because Wyley didn't know "what to do," they've managed to start a lovely and loving queer family with Rowan, their newest addition.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">But, there were some complications.</h2><p>As WE teases in their description of tonight's episode, "an expectant parent is rushed to the hospital when complications arise."&nbsp;From the looks of the Stephan's social media, Wyley had to give birth via C-section.&nbsp;</p><p>"So... pushing didn't go as planned," writes Stephan in the caption of a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> that shows Wyley on a gurney in the hospital, being wheeled away. "Almost 3 full days of labour and now we are just getting this baby out! I love my man so much. Never met a stronger human."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>Wyley then suffered something many go through but don't talk about: post-partum depression. In a post on social media, he revealed that he endured a "long mental battle with post-partum depression," adding that "most people don't glorify the hard parts of pregnancy."</p><p>Although he says the past few months have been "rough," he assures his followers he's on the upswing. "I am doing better, but still have 'those' days ... for now I am all smiles and things shall get better," he shared.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Today, Baby Rowan is the center of Wyley and Stephan's lives.</h2><p>Born just a few months ago on September 5th, Rowan is the newest addition to Stephan and Wyley's now-official family. And the three of them look happier than ever. Between adventuring and brunching together, baby boy Rowan appears to be getting a ton of love from his "Daddy and Papa." How absolutely adorable.
