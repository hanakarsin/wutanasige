Wike Asked Important Question</h1><section class=body itemprop=articleBody><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.naijanews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/images.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><h2>Rivers State Governor, <a href=# rel=noopener>Nyesom Wike</a> and his allies demanding the resignation of the Peoples Democratic Party (PDP) National Chairman, Iyorchia Ayu have been urged to have a rethink about their demand.</h2><p>They were told it is not new nor is it unusual for a party’s national chairman and its presidential candidate to be from the same region.</p><p>The demand of the Wike camp has thrown the PDP into an internal crisis a few months before the 2023 general elections with the Rivers Governor vowing not to have anything to do with the presidential bid of the party’s candidate, <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Atiku Abubakar</a></strong>.</p><p>Ayu on his part has also promised not to resign based on the demand of an individual, arguing that he can only resign if the PDP asks him to leave the position, <strong>Naija News</strong> reports.</p><p>Speaking on the development, a coalition of civil society organisations under the aegis of Better Life for Nigeria, said Wike and his loyalists are trying to pocket the party.</p><p>The group in a statement by its national coordinator, <strong>Waheed Abduljeleel</strong> further accused Wike of political brashness and throwing tantrums.</p><p>Questioning Wike in his submission, the group’s leader wondered what would be the fate of Ayu if he resigns and Atiku still loses the 2023 presidential election.</p><p>He said, “The idea was to have a national party where decisions will be taken by all members, and not a party in the pocket of a single individual. Ayu said in his interview with Arise TV that he will resign if the party asked him to resign (not an individual). The NWC which is the highest decision body of the party passed a vote of confidence on Ayu and asked him to stay.</p><p>“This situation that has a presidential candidate and Chairman of the party from one zone pre-election is not new. Ahmadu Ali from North Central was Chairman when Musa Yar’Adua from North West was the presidential candidate of PDP between 2006 and 2007. What if Ayu resigns and Atiku fails to win, will he be given back his mandate to complete the constitutional four years?</p><p>“In any case, the PDP State Excos in Lagos, Osun, Ogun, Ondo, Edo, Bayelsa, Akwa Ibom, Cross-River, and Delta have thrown their support to Ayu and passed a vote of confidence on him. The presidential zoning committee was about zoning the presidential ticket to South East with Peter Obi likely to get the ticket, Wike insisted that the zoning should be thrown open, knowing that GEJ got the South-South slot.</p><h2>Wike Is Playing Bitter Politics</h2><p>Speaking further, Abduljeleel said Wike is not fighting for the party or his people, arguing that the Rivers Governor is looking for a way to be in charge of the party post-2023 after losing the presidential ticket.</p><p>“Wike wants to foist a Chairman on the PDP that will work against Atiku so that Atiku will lose the 2023 election and leave the PDP for him and his group post-2023. They need a party Chairman that will do their bidding like what Adamu Mu’azu did to GEJ in 2015.</p><p>“Wike is not fighting for the South, he is a bitter loser fighting to destroy the PDP because he did not get the ticket of the party. His frustration after losing the presidential primary has made him confused, as throwing tantrums and dancing like a clown is now his trademark,” he said.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe5BpZqmcoGKws7XSoqpmoZZirrrBjKucrKGXo8Burc2dZJqsmaDCbrLAoqOsZaSkeri1zWauoZmkYrWivM%2Bepaxlp564pnnArKKenF2eurG70a2Yp6xdpsKmv9Oipqdn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
