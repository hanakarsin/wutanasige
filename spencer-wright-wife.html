He's been part of various competitions since 2010 and has racked up several accomplishments. According to his official career bio, he won the title of rodeo world champion back in 2014 and has gone on to consistently rank in world standings and won several other local rodeo competitions. As of 2024, he still competes and has earned $1,129,833 throughout his career.</p><p>Aside from being a professional rodeo legend, Spencer is a proud family man. He and his wife, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Kallie</a>, have been with each other since 2018 and they've since had several kids together. His entire family has even supported him by attending several of his rodeo competitions throughout the years. Unfortunately, the family suffered an incredibly tragic loss in 2024 and are still reeling from it. In early June of that year, Kallie shared a heartbreaking update on their young son.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@officialspencerwright</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Spencer Wright and his wife mourn their son. What happened to young Levi Wright?</h2><p>Not much is known about Kallie Wright. She's shared very few details about her personal life on social media, save for the fact that she's the proud wife of Spencer and even prouder mother of several children.</p><p>She and Spencer first tied the knot back in 2018. On <a href=#>Instagram</a>, the rodeo star <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">said</a> he was "the luckiest man in the world" for being able to marry Kallie. He was even happier to have become a father three times over. In <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2019</a>, they welcomed their first child named Steeley.</p><p>Later in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2021</a>, Levi came into the world. Not long after that in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">2023</a>, their third child Brae was born. Though Kallie may be pretty shy on her social media pages, she's been more than happy to be pictured alongside her family. Unfortunately, the Wright family suffered an unimaginable loss in 2024.</p><p>On June 2, 2024, Kallie posted on Facebook that Levi had passed away at only three years old. He'd been in critical condition in the hospital after accidentally driving his toy tractor into a river on May 21. Up until his passing, Kallie had been sharing constant health updates on his condition, which seemed to be getting worse by the day. She was met with an outpouring of support from friends and fans. However, she would share one last update on his untimely death after weeks of intensive care.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>Kallie shared a long and emotional Facebook post shortly before Levi passed away. She stated, "I know there are angels up there waiting to hold him until I can again! We will miss him every second of every day down here, but feel without unwavering doubt this is the best thing we can do for him."</p><p>Our thoughts go out to Kallie Wright and her family during this difficult time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqL2musKeqWavop60qcCMsKCfnQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
