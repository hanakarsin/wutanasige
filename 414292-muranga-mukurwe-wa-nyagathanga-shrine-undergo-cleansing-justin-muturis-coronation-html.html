This is why our elders will be going there to pray to God to forgive all of us who might have gone against our traditions," Njoroge added.<p class=align-left>Njoroge said that the event ceremony would be presided over by leaders from<a href=#> Murang’a county</a>.</p>"We have also assured our security officers that it is our responsibility to ensure there is peace during the entire exercise.

They were worried about our security and the COVID-19 health protocols. We told them that we had found a bigger venue at Mumbi Stadium where we shall sit down per the COVID-19 rules as our elders continue with the ceremony on the other side, and they agreed to the request," Munga explained.<p class=align-left>Munga further assured the elders of going ahead with the ceremony, assuring them of their <a href=#>security</a>.</p>"For a very long time, there has been unnecessary antagonism between the Kikuyu Council of Elders and Kiama Kiama, but we had already made efforts, come together, and we are acting as one about giving the Kikuyu nation clear and direct guidance," said Munga.<a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.tuko.co.ke/images/560x315/9a029e710ae37174.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Atwoli Road: COTU Boss Condemns Vandalism on Road Signpost Days After Its Launch</span></p></a><p class=align-left><strong>PAY ATTENTION: Don't miss trending Kenyan news. <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Follow TUKO.co.ke on Twitter!</a></strong></p><p class=align-left>Another event organiser Mukuna was Kariuki, who said that there is no division in this particular case.</p>"It is only that some people are not happy when Kikuyus are united, but we are going to assure them that we are united more than ever.
