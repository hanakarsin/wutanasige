"It's a fantastic opportunity and the start of a great relationship where we could do a lot of good for people through the teams that don't win."</p><p>In a January 2024 <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>, Good360 shared that the losing team's hoodies and hats end up in other countries like Europe, Africa, or Asia — but fans aren't going to see the shirts or merchandise anywhere in the U.S.</p><p>Interestingly, the process of putting the merchandise in the right hands is more fraught with potential problems than you might think. It turns out that some groups may seek to profit off of the shirts by reselling them, which is something that Good360 guards against.</p><p>Ultimately, as the post notes, "For the <a href=#>losing Super Bowl team</a>, it’s a bittersweet consolation prize knowing that their loss is helping to support people in need and preventing waste."</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">You can already buy Super Bowl champion shirts for either team.</h2><p>Although the 2024 matchup between the <a href=#>Kansas City Chiefs</a> and the <a href=#>San Francisco 49ers</a> hasn't been played yet, retailers and online sellers are already pushing champion shirts for both teams.</p><p>It's the official <a href=#>NFL apparel</a> that gets donated, since obviously anyone can create a shirt declaring one team the winner.
