As a result, travel restrictions such as suspension of incoming and outgoing flights were placed on citizens, including those traveling with dual citizenship to curtail the fast spread of the virus.</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/1120/7f4eb0e783a4090d.jpeg><p class=align-left>The rollout of COVID-19 vaccines already begins, and most wealthy Africans with certain limitations from their countries, such as travel ban, inadequate health care facilities, absence of vaccines and delivery, are now sourcing for the second passport by investment to access the vaccines.</p><p class=align-left>At the same time, <a id=https://migronis.com/en/blog/comparison-of-caribbean-citizenship-by-investment-programs href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Caribbean countries</a> like Antigua and Barbuda, Grenada, Dominica, Saint Kitts and Nevis, and Saint Lucia, among others, are places where most wealthy people from Nigeria are already getting the best second passport.</p><h2>Dual citizenship in Nigeria: An overview</h2><p class=align-left><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">Dual citizenship</a> simply means a lawful status whereby someone is regarded as a citizen of two or more countries under their respective laws. For example, Nigerians are widely known to have been involved in the CBI/RBI programs in Caribbean countries like Grenada, primarily for financial empowerment and easy access to the US.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/92749d2a45559ab2.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Nigerian graduates missing as UK starts High-potential Visa application</span></p></a><p class=align-left>However, the aim of traveling with two passports took a different turn with the arrival of Covid-19, from financial empowerment to quality health and <a href=#>education</a>. Since getting a second passport has become one of the people's concerns, it is no longer a surprise to see wealthy persons and politicians having dual citizenship in Nigeria.</p><h3>Does Nigeria allow dual citizenship?</h3><p class=align-left>The <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">laws favour dual citizenship</a> in Nigeria, and it can be achieved by birth, registration/marriage, and naturalisation. It is important to note that citizens with two passports are allowed to <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">hold public offices</a>. However, a dual citizen may also be subject to obligations of citizenship such as payment of tax and other civic duties.</p><h2>Requirements for traveling with dual passports</h2><p class=align-left>One of the first things to do in order to travel with two passports is looking for official information. This way you can know the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">travel requirements</a> to your destination. These may be different for some citizens or others, depending on their nationality. For example, you can travel without a visa to Morocco if you have a Nigerian passport.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.legit.ng/images/560x315/vllkyt43qqqdi59d8.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Consider these great NGO jobs in Nigeria</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Simultaneously, U.S.-Nigeria dual-national citizens are required to have a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">valid Nigerian passport</a> to leave the country. Dual-national citizens can be and often are denied boarding until they have acquired valid Nigerian passports.</p><p class=align-left>However, citizens of other nationalities suffer a different fate and must apply for a visa at the corresponding Embassy. Therefore, if you win with one of your passports because it avoids paperwork, do not hesitate to use it to enter the country you want to travel to. Then, when you leave, present this same passport that you gave at your entrance.</p><h2>Passport power comparison</h2><p class=align-left>Passports are essential items for every traveler, but the nationality of a passport can significantly affect travel plans and time abroad. Therefore, there is a need to analyse this document's influence on travel to discover the most powerful countries with dual citizenship.</p><li>Nigeria has visa-free access to 46 countries. Unfortunately, the Nigeria passport holds little value due to its recurrent fraud, misconduct, and corruption.</li><li>Ghana: The Ghanaian passport can help you reach only 64 destinations that is a very low number compared to other countries.</li><li>South Africa: South Africa's passport gives free access to 102 countries.

Therefore, Caribbean citizens enjoy certain privileges from the UK government. A few of the benefits include studying in British educational institutions and access to other countries of the Commonwealth, including Australia and Canada.</p><p class=align-left>Moreover, investors can get a return on their investment. For example, suppose an investor put their money in real estate/ invested in real estate. In that case, these properties can be sold after a few years, thereby enabling the investor to recover the amount paid for the second passport investment.</p><p class=align-left>Also, the second passport gives its holder the freedom to carry out business activities and make partnership deals with other partners without any capital restrictions in business transactions. As a result of the travel restrictions imposed on several countries, the second passport can help its holders bypass specific sanctions from the government in an emergency.</p><h3>Obtaining citizenship and passport in Antigua and Barbuda - starts at $100,000</h3><p class=align-left>Antigua and Barbuda are two islands in the Caribbean, separated by just 32 miles.

The golden visa is a quick way for foreign investors from countries outside the European Union to obtain a valid permanent residence in Portugal. The program's aim is straightforward and flexible with precise legal requirements. Getting the 2nd passport of Portugal can be via:</p><p class=align-left>1. Investments in real estate</p><ul><li>€280,000 — special projects that reduce the investment and allow an investor to obtain a residence permit.</li><li>€350,000 — investment in a property that is subject to reconstruction and was built 30 years ago.</li><li>€500,000 — investment in any real estate.</li></ul><p class=align-left>Why it is relevant now: from January 2022, Porto and Lisbon will leave this program.</p><p class=align-left>2.

Since buying a second passport is in high demand, there are many scams that you can run into, so you must be very careful.</p><p></p><p>Source: Legit.ng</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHGoqtnppdkfnV%2FkGpsbGWVlsC6edOrmK%2BdnKh6t63CnKCnnaNitbDDjKycnKeemXqxrdKsp6iqpGK9orrDnqSim16dwa64</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
