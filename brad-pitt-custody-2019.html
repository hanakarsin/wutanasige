Things have been messy.</h2><p>But in 2016, Brangelina parted ways, and it effectively tore their family apart. As you could probably imagine, I was downright devastated. Will Brad ever find love? It seems as though his relationship with Angelina is totally and utterly done, and when they first split, it seemed like his kids wanted nothing to do with him.&nbsp;</p><p>But now, in 2019, does <a href=#>Brad Pitt have custody</a> of his kids? Here is everything we know regarding the matter.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">It all started on a plane in 2016.&nbsp;</h2><p>Brad, Angelina, and the kids were flying from Nice, France, to Los Angeles, Calif. And at the time, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brad was reportedly drinking heavily</a>, according to The Sun.&nbsp;</p><p>At some point on the flight, Brad and his 15-year-old son, Maddox, were involved in an angry altercation. This ultimately led to Angelina filing for divorce that September, and it's also when he become estranged from his son.&nbsp;</p><p>Almost a year later in June 2017, Brad and Angie were still sorting out child custody — per Us Weekly, the Los Angeles County DCFS <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cleared Pitt of child abuse allegations</a> (re: his altercation with Maddox).</p><p>Brangelina's six kids (Shiloh, Viv, Maddox, Zahara, Knox, and Pax were living with Angelina, but Brad was allowed supervised visitation with the kids. They still had child support issues to sort out, but they ultimately decided a life totally without dad would be detrimental.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Eventually, they reached a less rigid custody agreement in November 2018.</h2><p>The court decided <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Brad would get less than half of custody over their six kids</a>, per Hollywood Life. And even though the arrangement was complicated, Angelina has said that Brad was getting tons of visitation hours.</p><p>However, as of October 2019, she still has no plans to give up primary custody.</p><p>That's right — it seems as though there is no possibility of Brad getting full custody of the kids. However, apparently their system is totally free of drama.&nbsp;</p><p>"They travel back and forth with their bodyguards and drivers and Angelina doesn’t go along for the hand off. It is very well coordinated and drama free," a source told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollywood Life.</a></p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty</span></figure><p>It goes without saying that Brad is doing better than he was three years ago, at the time of his split with Angelina. And luckily, it sounds like he sees his kids on a semi-regular basis (aside from Maddox, who is in college in Korea).&nbsp;</p><p>Now, with <a href=#>rumors that he's dating</a> — once again —&nbsp;it seems like Brad is really getting his life back together. Whatever happens, though, we're totally rooting for him.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfl7%2BisIypoK2sXZjCtMDOnbBmamBmhg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
