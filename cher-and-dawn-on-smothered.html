"She always made an effort to want to be there and to try hard to be involved as much as she could," the 28-year-old shares.</p><p>Here’s what you need to know about the twosome before watching them on sMothered.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.distractify.com/data:><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Cher used to lie to her father about playing hooky with Dawn.</h2><p>One of Cher’s favorite memories growing up was girls’ days with her mom — which often included calling out sick from school. When the duo would get home from their shopping trips, they’d often fib about what they had been up to.</p><p>"My dad would say, 'so how was school today?' And I’d be like, 'it was great!'" Cher recalls. The brunette beauty ultimately hopes the bond she and Dawn share will inspire viewers.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p>"I’m hoping what people will take away from watching us is that for mothers out there, first of all, you don’t have to just be a mom, you can take that hat off and you can be a friend too," Cher says.&nbsp;"And for daughters that are watching, I’m hoping that you can see it can be an amazing experience being close with your mom and having your mom be your best friend."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Cher’s husband hasn’t really gotten used to his wife and mother-in-law’s unique dynamic.&nbsp;</h2><p>Plastic surgery resident Jared Gopman admits that it’s sometimes "overwhelming" to be around the pair.

Luckily, the University of Florida grad has had some time to adapt.&nbsp;</p><p>"We met our freshman year and were college sweethearts, we got engaged at the end of college and then married one year later," Cher recently told the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">New York Post</a> of her and Jared’s relationship.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The couple is currently expecting baby No. 1.</h2><p>In the first episode of sMothered, we learn that Cher has waited seven and a half weeks to tell her mom that she’s pregnant at Jared’s behest. Though he’d like her to keep the secret a little bit longer so that all of the grandparents can find out at once, the registered nurse is determined to share the news with Dawn first.</p><p>"She only has one daughter," Cher explains to her husband. "And she’s not just everybody else, she’s my mom." Cher goes on to tell the camera, "This is [my and my mom’s] special time. This isn’t [Jared’s]."
