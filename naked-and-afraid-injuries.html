However, those competing on Naked and Afraid XL are awarded a $24,000 prize as the challenge requires double the time as the original series.</p><p>"What I always say is, 'This is who we are. This is what we are made of,'" Season 2 contestant Jeff Zausch previously divulged. "Some people were made to be race car drivers. Some people were, you know, made to be CEOs of companies.
