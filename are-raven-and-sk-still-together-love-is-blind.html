Yes, five of the <a href=#>Netflix</a> couples were engaged by Episode 3 after their time in the pods connecting through conversations, but it’s not likely that all of these couples will last in the long run. One of the couples many were hesitant about was <a href=#>Raven and SK</a>.</p><p>Bartise openly shared his attraction for Raven, even telling his fiancée, Nancy, about how attracted he is to the pilates instructor. But once he tried to get emotionally close with Raven in the pool, the blond bombshell shut him down like a true queen.</p><p>However, after Episode 10 sent shock waves through social media with SK saying "I don't" at the altar, his cryptic language left viewers wondering if the chapter is actually closed with Raven.

SK even proposed to her (and she accepted) in Episode 3, which was filmed in fall 2022.</p><p>However, a few months later, Raven offered an update: SK and Raven are not still together today. “Since then, a lot has changed. My world is completely different because, you know, SK cheated on me and now our relationship is over,” Raven later told the camera.</p><p>She added: “It’s so crazy to watch it back and, like, remember my feelings then. ... I was so happy. I really was so invested in the person that everyone saw and everyone loved, like, that’s the person that I saw and I loved every day too. So, to see everything that has happened since then is so hard because that was not the person that I thought that I was with.”</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">SK turned Raven down at their wedding on 'Love Is Blind' — but were together at the reunion.</h2><p>In the reunion episode, both Raven and SK confirmed that they were still an item.
