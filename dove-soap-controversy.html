The issue focuses on an incident from 2020, when Zyanha and Morgan were both students at the University of Virginia. At the time, Zyanha claimed that she heard Morgan refer to Black Lives Matter protesters as "good speed bumps," before later admitting that she likely "misheard" Morgan.</p><p>Zyanha then campaigned to have Morgan disciplined by the university, and Morgan's school records show that she did face disciplinary action as a result of the campaign. The details of this story have left many outraged, which is part of the reason they feel that Dove's partnership is inappropriate.</p><p>These calls for boycotts are just the latest in a line of recent corporate backlashes over companies working with people that a portion of the public finds inappropriate or even dangerous.</p><p>The most famous of these boycotts came with <a href=#>Bud Light</a> announced a partnership with trans influencer <a href=#>Dylan Mulvaney</a>. The subsequent backlash led to a severe dip in the company's stock price, even though Dylan wasn't accused of doing anything like the story about Zyanha.</p><p>Dove hasn't commented on the backlash yet, but given how these boycotts have spread over the internet, they may eventually be forced to.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by zyahna bryant.
