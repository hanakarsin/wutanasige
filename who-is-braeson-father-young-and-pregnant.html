At the time of Braeson's birth, there was no biological father listed, but <a href=#>Brianna's then-boyfriend Danae</a> had decided to raise the child as his own.</p><p>But since the split of Brianna and Danae, there are more questions than ever about <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">who Braeson's biological father is</a>. And this new season just might give us insight as to who it actually is.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">Who is Braeson's father on Teen Mom: Young and Pregnant? It might be a guy that Brianna hooked up with once.</h2><p>In a new episode of Teen Mom: Young and Pregnant, we see Brianna grappling with a myriad of daddy issues — hers and Braeson's.&nbsp;</p><p>Throughout the season, we saw that Braeson had clung to Danae as his daddy, but then after he left he also clung to Brianna's new boyfriend Robert. He, too, eventually split with Brianna.</p><p>This leaves Brianna in a sticky situation, where she wants to give Braeson the relationship with a father that she never had.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>In the episode, Brianna gets a message from an old friend from high school. The friend said that since they hooked up during Brianna's break from then-beau Danae, that there was a possibility that he could be the father of Braeson.</p><p>While she was shocked, Brianna was willing to admit the possibility, and said that she will take a paternity test to reveal the identity of Braeson's father.&nbsp;</p><p>But Brianna's mom was not so happy to hear about this potential new father.</p><p>“It disturbs me that you were just having unprotected sex,” she told her daughter. “I thought you knew who the dad was but now it's like, ‘Oh there’s somebody else?’ I’m really shocked by this. It makes me worried about you and your self-worth.”</p><p>These are hard words to hear from mom, and Brianna admitted that the hookup was "dumb."</p><p>“I will die if he is the dad," she said. "because I was 100 percent sure he was not. And I still don’t think he is, but whatever.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>I only want the best for Braeson, with or without his grandfather...
