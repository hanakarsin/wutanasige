In the absence of Boniface, Atalanta forward, Ademola Lookman is the second most expensive player with a market value of €30 million.</p><p>Alex Iwobi (€28 million), Samuel Chukwueze (€25 million), and Terem Moffi (€25 million) are rated third, fourth, and fifth respectively in the Super Eagles squad.</p><p>Meanwhile, 2023 AFCON winners, Ivory Coast, who were rated third before the AFCON, are now second in Africa with a value of €315 million.</p><p>Morocco have dropped to third with €294 million, while Senegal (€269 million), and Algeria (€238m) complete the top five.</p><p>On the world stage, England remain the most valuable squad in the world with a market value of €1.41 billion, followed by France with €1.23bn squad value.</p><p>Portugal (€1.04bn), Brazil (€914m) and Spain (€853m) complete the top five most valuable squads in the world.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpkZH10e5FqZqytoJq%2FbrHAoKOeq12ks266yKCcq6GRqHq0vdSam2aukaHCpnnDq6apq12Ws7Wx0WZpaWpjYq6nr86nZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
