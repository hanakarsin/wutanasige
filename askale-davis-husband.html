Drè had a few days off in between his tour dates, so he flew in to take me out. We ended up missing our restaurant reservations, so we decided to hit up a local late night restaurant for dinner.”</p><p>She went on: “I remember being so excited and nervous at the same time. I mean, I knew we meshed well as friends, but how would we be as lovers? Well, based on the second picture, I guess we ended up meshing very well.”</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>And in an Instagram caption in September 2020, Askale <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">discussed</a> her decision to join Drè in a <a href=#>blended family</a> — and she praised the two kids he brought to the relationship. “That decision was one of the best things I could’ve done,” she told followers.</p><p>“Since my very first encounter with my bonus babies, Bleu and River, they have been a true blessing to my life. They’ve been such a source of unconditional love and light, and I’m so thankful that God chose me to be a receiver of all that they have to offer. I truly can’t express how blessed I feel to have them in my life. … My parents, brother, cousins, we’re all just one big, happy, blended family.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhflsCsrcueZJ2Zpp7AbrTUrJmappQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
