Unfortunately, when the government is trying to make sure we have peace, some political elites are thinking they don’t want us to succeed.</p><p>“So they’ve been making so many unprecedented comments about the dialogue issues and the reconciliation. And some of them that have connections with the criminals have been telling them all sorts of things so that they shouldn’t believe the government’s amnesty and reconciliation.</p><p>“We have some records. Some of the informants that were arrested, we have over 2000 informants under the custody of security agencies, and some of them have opened up and indicted so many people. They said some of the politicians are the ones funding them, telling them the state and federal government are not serious on what we promise to them.”</p><p>Meanwhile, the former Governor of Gombe State, <strong>Senator Danjuma Goje</strong>, was reportedly <strong><a href=#>subjected to humiliation</a></strong> on Friday in Gombe, the state capital.</p><p>According to the spokesman of the lawmaker,&nbsp;<strong>Lilian Nworie</strong>, her principal’s vehicles were attacked by some political thugs around International Conference Centre on the Bauchi – Gombe Road.</p><p>Nworie stated Goje’s vehicles were attacked with dangerous weapons as he was about to enter the state capital for a personal engagement.</p><p>The media aide stated that the thugs set bonfires on the main road, preventing the Gombe Central Senator from entering into the state.</p><p>Nworie, however, accused the state Governor, <strong>Inuwa Yahaya</strong>, of being the attack, adding that police officers stationed in the area failed to arrest the thugs during the incident.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5ye49uZqCnppq%2Fr7vRZqSarJGsrq24xGapnq6Vlrm0edKppqern6fAbrvFZpmappSewbR5yKdks5mdm66zrY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
