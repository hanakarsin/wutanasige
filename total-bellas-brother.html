Nikki revealed that J.J. offered his help in locating her birth certificate, but accidentally stumbled upon something he shouldn't have ... a drawer filled with sex toys.</p><p>Brie began: "He opens up her top drawer and he was like, 'She has to be kidding me.' Am I allowed to say sex toys? A gazillion sex toys! He called her and goes, 'Your birth certificate is in here?'''&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: E!</span></figure><p>Nikki added: ''I totally forgot. Then when he said it, I was like, 'Oh yeah.' Because I was thinking that if anyone was ever to rob me, no one was going to dig under my sex toys to take my social security card and my birth certificate. I thought it was a great plan!''&nbsp;</p><p>Following the traumatic event, J.J. eventually retrieved his sister's birth certificate. But, Nikki was also a bit bothered by it as well and revealed that she had to throw out the toys because her bro had "seen and touched" them.&nbsp;</p><p>Well, that's certainly one way to scare your siblings into never going through your things!</p><p>Total Bellas airs Thursdays at 9 p.m. ET on E!.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfqby1rctmmZ6knJbAbq7RqKuhnaI%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
