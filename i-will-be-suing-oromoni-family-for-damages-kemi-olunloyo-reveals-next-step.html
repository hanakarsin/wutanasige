He carries a dangerous ego which he feels he can use to intimidate the government and protect the people. I’m planning to sue him for dragging my professional reputation asking police to invite me for specifically my “reckless statement” concerning Sylvester Oromoni a fake petition we are yet to see.</p><p>“Reckless what? He wants to use scare tactics he uses with successive governments. If in fact he’s filing on behalf of the Oromoni family I will be suing them too for damages. The Oromoni family should fire him and use their senses. Falana is a distraction and one who loves media trials.”</p><p>She added that “The era of those who spoil my name in this country Nigeria will end soon. I know my legal rights. I have information that could make or break this case designed to ruin the reputation of so many others.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWphZH5ze5BuZqJlp565rXnBnmSsrZmjtG670aikqKaZYrOiucilsGaen6d6pa3Mmp6eq12gsq61jKijrqacpMawedGerZ6ZnKh6r7HXrWSsrJWlfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
