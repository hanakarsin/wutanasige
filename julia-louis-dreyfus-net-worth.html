Whether you knew her first as Elaine Benes or you met her when she was VP Selina Meyer, you know that she is incredible in every project she touches. She is also ridiculously likable, and when you see her on screen, it feels like you're seeing an old pal.</p><p>With her incredible career, it makes sense that she would have an impressive net worth to show for it, right? On that note, here's what we know about that...</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>Julia with husband Brad and their sons Henry and Charlie in June 2024</p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-jhGSUB gJvRDP">What is Julia-Louis Dreyfus's net worth?</h2><p>Manhattan-born Julia broke into the comedy scene with Chicago's Practical Theatre Company before <a href=#>getting cast on Saturday Night Live</a> for its eighth season when she was 21. Her future husband, Brad Hall, actually joined her there at the same time, having both been recruited from their Chicago improv group. Julia stayed on <a href=#>SNL</a> until Season 10, later admitting that the show's environment (i.e., sexism and a whole lot of drug use) just wasn't for her.</p><p>Julia's big break would come in 1990, when she was cast as Elaine Benes on what would become one of the best sitcoms of all time — <a href=#>Seinfeld</a>. And even though she might forever be Elaine for many of us, she still somehow managed to move on to not one, but two successful shows after Seinfeld ended in 1998: The New Adventures of Old Christine (which ran from 2005 to 2010) and <a href=#>Veep</a> (which ran from 2011 to 2019). She's also made several appearances on the iconic <a href=#>Curb Your Enthusiasm</a>, playing a heightened version of herself.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span><p>The 'Seinfeld' gang</p></figure><p>Oh, and she's also snagged numerous awards and nominations along the way, including Emmys for all three of her aforementioned comedy series. And she very deservedly received the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor in 1998.</p><p>These days, she continues to act (she's even <a href=#>part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe</a> now), and you can listen to her delightful voice on her podcast, Wiser Than Me, which was named Apple's Best Podcast of the Year in 2023.</p><p>With this kind of incredible career, it only makes sense that Julia has amassed a pretty penny. According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a>, she's worth a whopping $250 million. And lest you think that Julia's money may come from her family (her father was successful French businessman Gérard Louis-Dreyfus, who died in 2016), it appears she has not yet inherited her portion of her father's reported $4 billion estate.</p><p class="sc-ktvXtq dPyThM"><span>Julia Louis-Dreyfus</span></p><p class="sc-fxFQrc gpgOkp">Actress, Comedian</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $250 million</p><p style=text-align:start>Julia Louis-Dreyfus is a beloved actress and comedian who is best known for her work on Seinfeld and Veep.</p><p style=text-align:start><strong>Birthdate</strong>: Jan. 13, 1961</p><p style=text-align:start><strong>Birthplace:</strong> New York, N.Y.</p><p style=text-align:start><strong>Birth name</strong>: Julia Scarlett Elizabeth Louis-Dreyfus</p><p style=text-align:start><strong>Father:</strong> Gérard Louis-Dreyfus</p><p style=text-align:start><strong>Mother:</strong> Judith LeFever</p><p style=text-align:start><strong>Marriages: </strong>Brad Hall​​ (m. 1981)</p><p style=text-align:start><strong>Children: </strong>Henry and Charlie</p><p>Along with her impressive resume, Julia also has a beautiful family.
