But now they’ve even evolved with getting stronger physical players as well. So we know the challenge is going to be difficult, but it will be a great experience for us in terms of preparing for the World Cup.”</p><p>The Coach noted that one of his main reason for okay this international friendly match was to level up with the quality and standards of the world cup</p><p>“So that’s one of the reasons we wanted to come here, because we know the quality of the team here in Japan, and that will certainly prepare us for the things that we need to work on over the next 12 months. As far as the World Cup, our expectations are to make a deep run, to get out of our group and make a deep run in the World Cup. “ he said.</p><p>At the time this report was put together, 15 players had already arrived at the camp.</p><h2>List Of Players In Camp In Kobe</h2><p>*Chiamaka Nnadozie<br>*Nkiruka Obidinma<br>*Glory Ogbonna<br>*Akudo Ogbonna<br>*Jumoke Alani<br>*Deborah Abiodun<br>*Esther Onyenezide<br>*Ashleigh Plumptre<br>*Rasheedat Ajibade<br>*Peace Efih<br>*Osinachi Ohale<br>*Michelle Alozie<br>*Ifeoma Onumonu<br>*Flourish Sabastine<br>*Christy Ucheibe<br>*Amanda Mbadi<br>*Ngozi Okobi<br>*Uche Kanu<br>*Vivian Ikechukwu</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGhpaWpiZH5xe49uZqGtl5p6o7vOrKtmnp%2Bnerity52prqVdlsBurcmimZqclWK8tLXNmpqhoV2Wu6V5zq2fnqqjYrewtc1mnZqkk6S7tHnFqKlmopGlrq9506KcZq6ZmbKwew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
