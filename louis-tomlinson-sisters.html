However, we can't forget the pain and suffering Louis went through last year. Just three years after his mother<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> Joannah died from leukemia</a>, his 18-year-old sister, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Felicité, died of a drug overdose</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The singer still has five siblings, however, whom he's remained quite close with.&nbsp;</p><p>Although Louis Tomlinson's family life has been tumultuous, to say the least, <a href=#>he's lucky to have four sisters (and a little brother!)</a> to lean on —&nbsp;here's what you need to know about each of them.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">After Louis, the oldest Tomlinson sibling is Charlotte.</h2><p>Louis' biological father, Troy Austin, left his mom, and she remarried Mark Tomlinson. Together, they had Charlotte,&nbsp;Louis' half-sister, who goes by the name Lottie. She&nbsp;is <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a 20-year-old makeup artist</a>, stylist, and Instagram influencer. According to Fandom, Lottie often styled One Direction during their On The Road Again Tour in 2015, and a year later, became a Nails Inc ambassador in 2016 for a spray-on nail polish called Paint Can.&nbsp;</p><p>The following year, Lottie released her first book called <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rainbow Roots: #MAKEUPBYME</a>, and started <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tanologist</a>, a line of self-tanning products. When Lottie isn't working, she loves to travel and post photos to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">her Instagram page</a>, which has gained over one million followers. According to Daily Mail, the artist and entrepreneur is reportedly dating Love Island Australia star, Dan Thomas — the two were recently seen together <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">cozying up on the beach in Barbados</a>.&nbsp;</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Next, we have the twins: Daisy and Phoebe.</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Daisy</a> and <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Phoebe</a> Tomlinson are 15-year-old twins, who currently reside with their father in Doncaster, England, according to Famous Birthdays. Both sisters are aspiring Instagram influencers, with over 600,000 followers each. And although they're significantly younger than their older siblings, they reportedly have remained close with them.</p><p>Daisy apparently began <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">dating famous YouTuber Tom Sharman in 2017,</a> and according to a 2019 article from Wiki Birthdays, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the two are still going strong</a>. There is not much public information regarding Phoebe's dating life at this time, and we probably won't know anything unless she posts about it on Instagram.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">Then there's the youngest sister, Doris, who has a twin brother.</h2><p>Louis' mom parted ways with Mark in 2015, and moved on to date a man named Daniel Deakin. Together, they had two kids — who were also a set of twins — named Doris and Ernest. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The youngest twins in the family are now 5 years old</a>, according to Famous Birthdays, and Louis was present when they were born. They now live with their father in England.&nbsp;</p><p>Like I said, Louis' family life hasn't been smooth-sailing these last few years, but he's incredibly lucky to be surrounded by so many loved ones. Congrats on a fantastic new album, Louis — you deserve it.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoby2tdJmq6ilnJ67tLvNZqqiq6Sav7Q%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 NovaBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_1.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
